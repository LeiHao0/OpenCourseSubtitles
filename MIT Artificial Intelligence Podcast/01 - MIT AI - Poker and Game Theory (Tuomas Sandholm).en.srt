it's not as competitive well heads up
 

99
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,969

in that sense but an imperfect
 

109
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,220
in that sense but an imperfect
information game which makes it much

110
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,230
information game which makes it much
 

111
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,559
information game which makes it much
harder because I have to deal with

112
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:21,569
harder because I have to deal with
 

113
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:24,809

instead of pieces being nicely laid on

120
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:29,319
instead of pieces being nicely laid on
 

121
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,780
instead of pieces being nicely laid on
the board for both of us to see

122
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:30,790
the board for both of us to see

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,500
the board for both of us to see
so in Texas Hold'em there's a two cards

124
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:34,510
so in Texas Hold'em there's a two cards
 

125
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,259
so in Texas Hold'em there's a two cards
that you only see the game on to you

126
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:37,269
that you only see the game on to you
 

127
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:39,660
that you only see the game on to you
yeah there is they gradually lay out

128
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:39,670
yeah there is they gradually lay out
 

129
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,120
yeah there is they gradually lay out
some cards that add up overall to five

130
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,130
some cards that add up overall to five
 

131
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,580
some cards that add up overall to five
cards that everybody can see yeah the

132
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:44,590
cards that everybody can see yeah the
 

133
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,650
cards that everybody can see yeah the
imperfect nature of the information is

134
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:46,660
imperfect nature of the information is
 

135
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,420
imperfect nature of the information is
the two cards that you're holding on

136
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:48,430
the two cards that you're holding on
 

137
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,490
the two cards that you're holding on
front yeah so as you said you know you

138
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:50,500
front yeah so as you said you know you
 

139
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,920
front yeah so as you said you know you
first get two cards in private each and

140
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:52,930
first get two cards in private each and
 

141
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,890
first get two cards in private each and
then you this a betting round then you

142
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:55,900
then you this a betting round then you
 

143
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,809
then you this a betting round then you
get three clubs in public on the table

144
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:57,819
get three clubs in public on the table
 

145
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,640
get three clubs in public on the table
then there's a betting round then you

146
00:02:59,640 --> 00:02:59,650
then there's a betting round then you
 

147
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,110
then there's a betting round then you
get the fourth card in public on the

148
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
get the fourth card in public on the
 

149
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,940
get the fourth card in public on the
table they're spitting around then you

150
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:02,950
table they're spitting around then you
 

151
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,650
table they're spitting around then you
get the five fifth card on the table

152
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:04,660

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,509
you will the only the first tranche is
private and they omits public from there

162
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
private and they omits public from there
 

163
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,240
private and they omits public from there
and this is probably probably by far the

164
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,250
and this is probably probably by far the
 

165
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,440
and this is probably probably by far the
most popular game in AI and just the

166
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,450
most popular game in AI and just the
 

167
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,210
most popular game in AI and just the
general public in terms of imperfect

168
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:27,220
general public in terms of imperfect
 

169
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,610
general public in terms of imperfect
information so it's probably the most

170
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:29,620
information so it's probably the most
 

171
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,069
information so it's probably the most
popular spectator game to watch right so

172
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:34,079
popular spectator game to watch right so
 

173

popular spectator game to watch right so
which is why it's a super exciting game

174
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:36,700

I would say in terms of popularity in
 

179
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,550
I would say in terms of popularity in
terms of AI setting it as the bar of

00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
terms of AI setting it as the bar of

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,080
terms of AI setting it as the bar of

not read the papers and study yeah so
 

201
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,530
not read the papers and study yeah so
the event was that we invited four of

the event was that we invited four of

Texas Hold'em which is very important
because this game is actually quite

because this game is actually quite
 

211
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,890
because this game is actually quite
different than the the multiplayer

for twenty days we wanted to get a

218
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:29,620
for twenty days we wanted to get a
 

219
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,350
for twenty days we wanted to get a
hundred and twenty thousand hands in

220
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
hundred and twenty thousand hands in
 

221
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,469
hundred and twenty thousand hands in
because we wanted to get statistical

222
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
because we wanted to get statistical
 

223
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,680
because we wanted to get statistical
significance so it's a lot of hands for

224
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:37,690
significance so it's a lot of hands for
 

225
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,379
significance so it's a lot of hands for
humans to play even for this top pros

226
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:40,389
humans to play even for this top pros
 

227
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:43,140
humans to play even for this top pros
who play fairly quickly normally so we

228
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,150
who play fairly quickly normally so we
 

229
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,480
who play fairly quickly normally so we
couldn't just have one of them play so

230
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,490
couldn't just have one of them play so
 

231
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,029
couldn't just have one of them play so
many hands twenty days they were playing

232
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:48,039
many hands twenty days they were playing
 

233
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,990
many hands twenty days they were playing
basically morning to evening and he

234
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
basically morning to evening and he
 

235
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,760
basically morning to evening and he
raised two hundred thousand as a little

236
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:53,770
raised two hundred thousand as a little
 

237
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,879
raised two hundred thousand as a little
incentive for them to play and the

238
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:56,889
incentive for them to play and the
 

239
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,980
incentive for them to play and the
setting was so that they didn't all get

240
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:58,990
setting was so that they didn't all get
 

241
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,010
setting was so that they didn't all get
fifty thousand we actually paid them out

242
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,020
fifty thousand we actually paid them out
 

243
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,350
fifty thousand we actually paid them out
based on how they did against the AI

244
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:04,360
based on how they did against the AI
 

245
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,310
based on how they did against the AI
each so they had an incentive to play as

246
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320
each so they had an incentive to play as
 

247
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,050
each so they had an incentive to play as
hard as they could whether they're way

248
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,060
hard as they could whether they're way
 

249
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,210
hard as they could whether they're way
ahead the way behind or right at the

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:12,220
ahead the way behind or right at the
 

251
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,610
ahead the way behind or right at the
mark of beating the AI and you don't

252
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:14,620
mark of beating the AI and you don't
 

253
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,620
mark of beating the AI and you don't
make any money unfortunately right no we

254
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:16,630
make any money unfortunately right no we
 

255
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,170
make any money unfortunately right no we
can't make any money so so originally a

256
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,180
can't make any money so so originally a
 

257
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,540
can't make any money so so originally a
couple of years earlier I actually

258
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:21,550
couple of years earlier I actually
 

259
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,430
couple of years earlier I actually
explored whether we could actually play

260
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
explored whether we could actually play
 

261
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,050
explored whether we could actually play
for money because that would be of

262
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,060
for money because that would be of
 

263
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,230
for money because that would be of
course interesting as well to play

264
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
course interesting as well to play
 

265
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,760
course interesting as well to play
against the top people for money but the

266
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:29,770
against the top people for money but the
 

267
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,279
against the top people for money but the

270
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
if we couldn't so this is much like an
 

271
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,189
if we couldn't so this is much like an
exhibit like for a musician or a boxer

272
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:38,199
exhibit like for a musician or a boxer
 

273
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,240
exhibit like for a musician or a boxer
or something like that

274
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,250
or something like that
 

275
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,189
or something like that
nevertheless you're keeping track of the

nevertheless you're keeping track of the
money and brought us one close to two

278
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:45,580
money and brought us one close to two
 

279
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,600
money and brought us one close to two
million dollars I think so so if there

280
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:48,610
million dollars I think so so if there
 

281
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,909
million dollars I think so so if there
if it was for real money if you were

282
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:50,919
if it was for real money if you were
 

283

if it was for real money if you were
able to earn money that was a quite

00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
able to earn money that was a quite
 

285
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,140
able to earn money that was a quite
impressive and inspiring achievement

players looking at I mean were they
behind the computer what was the

292
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,150
behind the computer what was the
 

293
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,360
behind the computer what was the
interface like yes there they were

294
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,370
interface like yes there they were
 

295
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,370
interface like yes there they were
playing much like they normally do these

296
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:05,380
playing much like they normally do these
 

297
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,080
playing much like they normally do these
top players when they play this game

298
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,090
top players when they play this game
 

299
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,450
top players when they play this game
they play mostly online so they used to

300
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:09,460
they play mostly online so they used to
 

301
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,180
they play mostly online so they used to
playing through what UI yes and they did

302
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,190
playing through what UI yes and they did
 

303
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,980
playing through what UI yes and they did
the same thing here so there was this

304
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:13,990
the same thing here so there was this
 

305
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,070
the same thing here so there was this
layout you could imagine there's a table

306
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
layout you could imagine there's a table
 

307
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,830
layout you could imagine there's a table
on the screen this the the human sitting

308
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
on the screen this the the human sitting
 

309
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,450
on the screen this the the human sitting
there and then there's the AI sitting

310
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:21,460
there and then there's the AI sitting
 

311
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,580
there and then there's the AI sitting
there and the the screen source

312
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:23,590
there and the the screen source
 

313
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,200
there and the the screen source
everything is happening the cards coming

314
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,210
everything is happening the cards coming
 

315
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,810
everything is happening the cards coming
out and so the bets being made and we

316
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:27,820
out and so the bets being made and we
 

317
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,640
out and so the bets being made and we
also had the betting history for the

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,920
also had the betting history for the
human so if the human for what what had

320
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:31,930
human so if the human for what what had
 

321
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,510
human so if the human for what what had
happened in the ham so far they could

322
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
happened in the ham so far they could
 

323
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,500
happened in the ham so far they could
actually reference back

324
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:35,510
actually reference back
 

325
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,720
actually reference back
and and and so forth is there a reason

326
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:37,730
and and and so forth is there a reason
 

327
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,940
and and and so forth is there a reason
they were given access to the betting

328
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:39,950
they were given access to the betting
 

329
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,590
they were given access to the betting
history for well we just uh it's a it

330
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:44,600
history for well we just uh it's a it
 

331
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,450
history for well we just uh it's a it
didn't really matter that they wouldn't

332
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:46,460
didn't really matter that they wouldn't
 

333
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,980
didn't really matter that they wouldn't
have forgotten anyway these are top

334
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:47,990
have forgotten anyway these are top
 

335
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,860
have forgotten anyway these are top
quality people but we just want to put

336
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:50,870
quality people but we just want to put
 

337
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,330
quality people but we just want to put
out there so it's not a question for

338
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:52,340
out there so it's not a question for
 

339
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,280
out there so it's not a question for
human for getting and the AI somehow

340
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,290
human for getting and the AI somehow
 

341
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,170
human for getting and the AI somehow
trying to get advantage of better memory

342
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:56,180
trying to get advantage of better memory
 

343
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,270
trying to get advantage of better memory
so what was that like I mean that was an

344
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,280
so what was that like I mean that was an
 

345
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,310
so what was that like I mean that was an
incredible accomplishment so what did it

346
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:00,320
incredible accomplishment so what did it
 

347
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,270
incredible accomplishment so what did it
feel like before the event did you have

348
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:04,280
feel like before the event did you have
 

349
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,590
feel like before the event did you have
doubt hope

350
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:05,600
doubt hope
 

351
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,740
doubt hope
where was your confidence at yeah that's

352
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:08,750
where was your confidence at yeah that's
 

353
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,650
where was your confidence at yeah that's
great so a great question so eighteen

354
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:11,660
great so a great question so eighteen
 

355
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,450
great so a great question so eighteen
months earlier I had organized the

356
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:13,460
months earlier I had organized the
 

357
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,430
months earlier I had organized the
similar brains versus AI competition

358
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
similar brains versus AI competition
 

359
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,770
similar brains versus AI competition
with our previous a I call clerical and

360
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:17,780
with our previous a I call clerical and
 

361
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,730
with our previous a I call clerical and
we couldn't beat the humans so this time

362
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:21,740
we couldn't beat the humans so this time
 

363
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,140
we couldn't beat the humans so this time
around it was only eighteen months later

364
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,150
around it was only eighteen months later
 

365
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,620
around it was only eighteen months later
and I knew that this new AI Lovato's was

366
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:26,630
and I knew that this new AI Lovato's was
 

367
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,440
and I knew that this new AI Lovato's was
way stronger but it's hard to say how

368
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,450
way stronger but it's hard to say how
 

369
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,630
way stronger but it's hard to say how
you'll do against the top humans before

370
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:31,640
you'll do against the top humans before
 

371
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,550
you'll do against the top humans before
you try so I thought we had about a

372
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:33,560
you try so I thought we had about a
 

373
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,820
you try so I thought we had about a
50/50 shot and the international betting

374
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:36,830
50/50 shot and the international betting
 

375
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,940
50/50 shot and the international betting
sites put us a us as a four to one or

376
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:39,950
sites put us a us as a four to one or
 

377
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,340
sites put us a us as a four to one or
five to one underdog so it's kind of

378
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:42,350
five to one underdog so it's kind of
 

379
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,590
five to one underdog so it's kind of
interesting that people really believe

380
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:44,600
interesting that people really believe
 

381
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,160
interesting that people really believe
in people and I get over AI not just

382
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,170
in people and I get over AI not just
 

383
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,690
in people and I get over AI not just
people people don't just believe over

384
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:49,700
people people don't just believe over
 

385
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,100
people people don't just believe over
believing themselves but they have

386
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,110
believing themselves but they have
 

387
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,900
believing themselves but they have
overconfidence in other people as well

388
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:52,910
overconfidence in other people as well
 

389
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,740
overconfidence in other people as well
compared to the performance of AI and

390
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:55,750
compared to the performance of AI and
 

391
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,730
compared to the performance of AI and
yeah so we were afford to 105 to 108

392
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:00,740
yeah so we were afford to 105 to 108
 

393
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,130
yeah so we were afford to 105 to 108
beating the humans in a row we were

394
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:03,140
beating the humans in a row we were
 

395
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,680
beating the humans in a row we were
still 50/50 on the international betting

396
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:05,690
still 50/50 on the international betting
 

397
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,510
still 50/50 on the international betting
sites do you think there's something

398
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
sites do you think there's something
 

399
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,300
sites do you think there's something
special and magical about poker and in

400
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:10,310
special and magical about poker and in
 

401
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,580
special and magical about poker and in
the way people think about it in a sense

402
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:12,590
the way people think about it in a sense
 

403
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,330
the way people think about it in a sense
you have I mean even in chess there's no

404
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:16,340
you have I mean even in chess there's no
 

405
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,690
you have I mean even in chess there's no
Hollywood movies poker is this the star

406
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:19,700
Hollywood movies poker is this the star
 

407
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,390
Hollywood movies poker is this the star
of many movies and there's this feeling

408
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
of many movies and there's this feeling
 

409
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,280
of many movies and there's this feeling
that certain human facial expressions

410
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,290
that certain human facial expressions
 

411
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,150
that certain human facial expressions
and body language eye movement all these

412
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:31,160
and body language eye movement all these
 

413
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,880
and body language eye movement all these
tells are critical to poker you can look

414
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:33,890
tells are critical to poker you can look
 

415
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,219
tells are critical to poker you can look

into somebody's soul understand their
 

417
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:38,020
into somebody's soul understand their
betting strategy and so on there so

418
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,030
betting strategy and so on there so
 

419
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,710
betting strategy and so on there so
that's probably why the possibly do you

that's probably why the possibly do you
 

421
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,940
that's probably why the possibly do you
think that is why people have a

think that is why people have a

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,430
think that is why people have a

what's the role these tells of these

00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
what's the role these tells of these
 

441
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,500
what's the role these tells of these
ideas that we romanticize yeah so I

442
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:14,510
ideas that we romanticize yeah so I
 

443
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,300
ideas that we romanticize yeah so I
split it into two parts so one is why do

444
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:17,310
split it into two parts so one is why do
 

445
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,350
split it into two parts so one is why do
humans trust he much more than AI and

446
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
humans trust he much more than AI and
 

447
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,720
humans trust he much more than AI and
all have overconfidence in humans yes I

448
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:23,730
all have overconfidence in humans yes I
 

449
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,520
all have overconfidence in humans yes I
think that's that's not really related

450
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,530
think that's that's not really related
 

451
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,500
think that's that's not really related
to tell a question it's just that

452
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:27,510
to tell a question it's just that
 

453
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,050
to tell a question it's just that
they've seen these top players how good

454
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,060
they've seen these top players how good
 

455
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,880
they've seen these top players how good
they are and they're really fantastic so

456
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:31,890
they are and they're really fantastic so
 

457
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,510
they are and they're really fantastic so
it's just hard to believe therefore that

458
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:35,520
it's just hard to believe therefore that
 

459
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,040
it's just hard to believe therefore that
the Navy I could beat them yeah so I

460
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,050
the Navy I could beat them yeah so I
 

461
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,480
the Navy I could beat them yeah so I
think that's where that comes from and

462
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:38,490
think that's where that comes from and
 

463
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,430
think that's where that comes from and
and that's actually maybe a more general

464
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:40,440
and that's actually maybe a more general
 

465
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,380
and that's actually maybe a more general
lesson about the AI that until you've

466
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:42,390
lesson about the AI that until you've
 

467
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,540
lesson about the AI that until you've
seen it over perform a human it's hard

468
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:44,550
seen it over perform a human it's hard
 

469
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,150
seen it over perform a human it's hard
to believe it it could but then the

470
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,160
to believe it it could but then the
 

471
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,680
to believe it it could but then the
tails a lot of these top players they're

472
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:51,690
tails a lot of these top players they're
 

473
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,460
tails a lot of these top players they're
so good at hiding tails that among the

474
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:55,470
so good at hiding tails that among the
 

475
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,790
so good at hiding tails that among the
top players it's actually not really

476
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:57,800
top players it's actually not really
 

477
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,650
top players it's actually not really
worth it for them to invest a lot of

478
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:00,660
worth it for them to invest a lot of
 

479
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,480
worth it for them to invest a lot of
effort trying to find tails in each

480
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,490
effort trying to find tails in each
 

481
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,490
effort trying to find tails in each
other because there's a so good at

482
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:04,500
other because there's a so good at
 

483
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,630
other because there's a so good at
hiding them so yes at the kind of Friday

484
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
hiding them so yes at the kind of Friday
 

485
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,030
hiding them so yes at the kind of Friday
evening game tells are gonna be a huge

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,370
evening game tells are gonna be a huge
thing you can read other people and if

488
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:13,380
thing you can read other people and if
 

489
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,870
thing you can read other people and if
you're a good reader you you'll read

490
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
you're a good reader you you'll read
 

491
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,030
you're a good reader you you'll read
them like an open book but at the top

00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
them like an open book but at the top
 

493
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,280

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,290
levels of poker no details become a list
 

495
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,930
levels of poker no details become a list
of the much much smaller and smaller

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:20,940
of the much much smaller and smaller
 

497
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,180
of the much much smaller and smaller
aspect of the game as you go to the top

498
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,190
aspect of the game as you go to the top
 

499
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,060
aspect of the game as you go to the top
levels the the amount of strategies the

500
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,070
levels the the amount of strategies the
 

501
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,840
levels the the amount of strategies the
amount of possible actions is is very

502
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:29,850
amount of possible actions is is very
 

503
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,350
amount of possible actions is is very
large ten to the power of one hundred

504
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
large ten to the power of one hundred
 

505
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,190
large ten to the power of one hundred
plus so there has to be some I've read a

506
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
plus so there has to be some I've read a
 

507
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,000
plus so there has to be some I've read a
few the papers related it has it has to

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,010
few the papers related it has it has to
 

509
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,830
few the papers related it has it has to
form some abstractions of various hands

510
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:42,840
form some abstractions of various hands
 

511
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,430
form some abstractions of various hands
and actions so what kind of abstractions

512
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:46,440
and actions so what kind of abstractions
 

513
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,400
and actions so what kind of abstractions
are effective for the game of poker yeah

514
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,410
are effective for the game of poker yeah
 

515
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,830
are effective for the game of poker yeah
so you're exactly right so when you go

516
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:51,840
so you're exactly right so when you go
 

517
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,910
so you're exactly right so when you go
from a game tree that's ten to the 161

518
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:54,920
from a game tree that's ten to the 161

especially in an imperfect information
 

521
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,300
especially in an imperfect information
game it's way too large to solve

00:10:59,300 --> 00:10:59,310
game it's way too large to solve
 

523
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,730
game it's way too large to solve
directly even with our fastest ik

finding algorithms so you wanna abstract

526
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:05,970
finding algorithms so you wanna abstract
 

527
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,680
finding algorithms so you wanna abstract
it first and abstraction in games is

528
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:09,690
it first and abstraction in games is
 

529
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,800
it first and abstraction in games is
much trickier than abstraction in mdps

530
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:12,810
much trickier than abstraction in mdps
 

531
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,410
much trickier than abstraction in mdps
or other single agent settings because

532
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:15,420
or other single agent settings because
 

533
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,300
or other single agent settings because
you have these abstraction pathologies

534
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:17,310
you have these abstraction pathologies
 

535
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,830
you have these abstraction pathologies
that if I have a finer grained

536
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:18,840
that if I have a finer grained
 

537
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,920
that if I have a finer grained
abstraction the strategy that I can get

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,420
abstraction the strategy that I can get
from that for the real game might

541
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,250
from that for the real game might
actually be worse than the strategy I

542
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:25,260
actually be worse than the strategy I
 

543
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,180
actually be worse than the strategy I

can get from the coarse-grained
 

545
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,890
can get from the coarse-grained
abstraction if you have to be very

00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,050
yeah baiting access or so there's
 

559
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,470
yeah baiting access or so there's
information obstruction to talk about

information obstruction to talk about
 

561
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,420
information obstruction to talk about
general games information abstraction

general games information abstraction
 

563
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,030
general games information abstraction
which is the abstraction of what chance

564
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
which is the abstraction of what chance
 

565
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,950
which is the abstraction of what chance
does and this would be the cards in the

567
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,440

case of poker and then there's action

568
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,450
case of poker and then there's action
 

569
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,530
case of poker and then there's action
abstraction which is abstracting the

abstraction which is abstracting the
 

571
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,230

information abstraction we were

580
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:09,140
information abstraction we were
 

581
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,200
information abstraction we were
completely automated so these were these

582
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,210
completely automated so these were these
 

583
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,900
completely automated so these were these
are algorithms but they do what we call

584
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:14,910
are algorithms but they do what we call
 

585
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,060
are algorithms but they do what we call
potential aware abstraction where we

586
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,070
potential aware abstraction where we
 

587
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,680
potential aware abstraction where we
don't just look at the value of the hand

588
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:18,690
don't just look at the value of the hand
 

589
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,020
don't just look at the value of the hand
but also how it might materialize in the

590
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,030
but also how it might materialize in the
 

591
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,030
but also how it might materialize in the
good or bad hands over time and it's a

592
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
good or bad hands over time and it's a
 

593
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,400
good or bad hands over time and it's a
certain kind of bottom-up process with

594
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,410
certain kind of bottom-up process with
 

595
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,350
certain kind of bottom-up process with
integer programming there and clustering

596
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
integer programming there and clustering
 

597
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
integer programming there and clustering
and various aspects how do you build

598
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,370
and various aspects how do you build
 

599
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,570
and various aspects how do you build
build this abstraction and then in the

600
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:32,580
build this abstraction and then in the
 

601
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,900
build this abstraction and then in the
action abstraction there it's largely

602
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:35,910
action abstraction there it's largely
 

603
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,430
action abstraction there it's largely
based on how humans other and other AIS

604
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:40,440
based on how humans other and other AIS
 

605
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,650
based on how humans other and other AIS
have played this game in the past but in

00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:42,660
have played this game in the past but in
 

607
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,930
have played this game in the past but in
the beginning we actually use an

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:44,940
the beginning we actually use an

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,270
the beginning we actually use an
automated action abstraction technology

610
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:47,280
automated action abstraction technology
 

611
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,500
automated action abstraction technology
which is provably convergent that it

612
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:51,510
which is provably convergent that it
 

613
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,270
which is provably convergent that it
finds the optimal combination of eight

614
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:53,280
finds the optimal combination of eight
 

615
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,790
finds the optimal combination of eight
sizes but it's not very scalable so we

616
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:55,800
sizes but it's not very scalable so we
 

617
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,410
sizes but it's not very scalable so we
couldn't use it for the whole game but

618
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:57,420
couldn't use it for the whole game but
 

619
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,790
couldn't use it for the whole game but
we used it for the first couple of

we used it for the first couple of
 

621
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,940
we used it for the first couple of
betting actions so what's more important

622
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:00,950
betting actions so what's more important
 

623
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,730
betting actions so what's more important
the strength of the hand so the

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:03,740
the strength of the hand so the

play them the actions does
you know the romanticized notion again

630
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:13,140
you know the romanticized notion again
 

631
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,780
you know the romanticized notion again
is that it doesn't matter what hands you

632
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:14,790
is that it doesn't matter what hands you
 

633
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,350
is that it doesn't matter what hands you
have that the actions the betting may be

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,120
have that the actions the betting may be
the way you win no matter what hands you

636
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,130
the way you win no matter what hands you
 

637
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,830
the way you win no matter what hands you
have yeah so that's why you have to play

638
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:21,840
have yeah so that's why you have to play
 

639
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,850
have yeah so that's why you have to play
a lot of hands so that the role of luck

640
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:24,860
a lot of hands so that the role of luck
 

641
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,610
a lot of hands so that the role of luck
gets smaller so you could otherwise get

642
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:28,620
gets smaller so you could otherwise get
 

643
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,140
gets smaller so you could otherwise get
lucky and get some good hands and then

644
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,150
lucky and get some good hands and then
 

645
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,970
lucky and get some good hands and then
you're gonna win the match even with

646
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:31,980
you're gonna win the match even with
 

647
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,420
you're gonna win the match even with
thousands of hands you can get lucky

648
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:34,430
thousands of hands you can get lucky
 

649
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,430
thousands of hands you can get lucky
because there's so much variance in No

650
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440

653
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,040

655
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,400
go all-in it's a huge stack or variant
so there are these massive swings in No

656
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,410
so there are these massive swings in No
 

657
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,500
so there are these massive swings in No
Limit Texas Hold'em so that's why you

659
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,560
Limit Texas Hold'em so that's why you

00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,740
allowing where we allow with the
opponent to actually take different

799
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320

different way of doing it and it doesn't

800
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,330
different way of doing it and it doesn't
 

801
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,540
different way of doing it and it doesn't
assume therefore a particular way that

00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:02,550
assume therefore a particular way that

00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,730
assume therefore a particular way that
the opponent plays but it allows

804
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:04,740
the opponent plays but it allows
 

805
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,130
the opponent plays but it allows
opponent to choose from a set of

806
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,140
opponent to choose from a set of
 

807
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,770
opponent to choose from a set of
different continuation strategies and

808
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:09,780
different continuation strategies and
 

809
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,460
different continuation strategies and
that forces us to not be too optimistic

810
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:12,470
that forces us to not be too optimistic
 

811
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,860
that forces us to not be too optimistic
in our local head search and that's

812
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:15,870
in our local head search and that's
 

813
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,720
in our local head search and that's
that's one way you can do sound look

814
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:17,730
that's one way you can do sound look
 

815
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,360
that's one way you can do sound look
ahead search in imperfect information

816
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:20,370
ahead search in imperfect information
 

817
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,880

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:22,890
games which is very different difficult
 

819
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,340
games which is very different difficult
and in us you were asking about deep

820
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:25,350
and in us you were asking about deep
 

821
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,890
and in us you were asking about deep
stack what they did it was very

822
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:27,900
stack what they did it was very
 

823
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,840
stack what they did it was very
different than what we do either in Lee

824
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:29,850
different than what we do either in Lee
 

825
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,630
different than what we do either in Lee
brothers or in this new work

826
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:31,640
brothers or in this new work
 

827
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,970
brothers or in this new work
they were gender and Umrah generating

828
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:33,980
they were gender and Umrah generating
 

829
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,730
they were gender and Umrah generating
various situations in the game then they

830
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:36,740
various situations in the game then they
 

831
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,770
various situations in the game then they
were doing Luca head from there to the

832
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:38,780
were doing Luca head from there to the
 

833
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,050
were doing Luca head from there to the
end of the game as if that was a start

834
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,060
end of the game as if that was a start
 

835
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,450
end of the game as if that was a start
of a different game and then they were

836
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:43,460
of a different game and then they were
 

837
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,930
of a different game and then they were
using deep learning to learn those

838
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:45,940
using deep learning to learn those
 

839
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,490
using deep learning to learn those
values of those states but the states

840
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:48,500
values of those states but the states
 

841
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,380
values of those states but the states
were not just the physical states they

842
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:50,390
were not just the physical states they
 

843
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,720
were not just the physical states they
include the belief distributions when

844
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:52,730
include the belief distributions when
 

845
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,530
include the belief distributions when
you talk about look ahead for deep stack

846
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:56,540
you talk about look ahead for deep stack
 

847
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,920
you talk about look ahead for deep stack
or with libertas does it mean

848
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:58,930
or with libertas does it mean
 

849
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,330
or with libertas does it mean
considering every possibility that the

850
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:01,340
considering every possibility that the
 

851
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,040
considering every possibility that the
game can involve is that we're talking

852
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,050
game can involve is that we're talking
 

853
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,900
game can involve is that we're talking
about extremely sort of like this

854
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:04,910
about extremely sort of like this
 

855
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,780
about extremely sort of like this
exponentially growth of a tree yes so

856
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:07,790
exponentially growth of a tree yes so
 

857
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,810
exponentially growth of a tree yes so
we're talking about exactly that

858
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:10,820
we're talking about exactly that
 

859
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,289
we're talking about exactly that
much like you do in Alpha Beta search or

860
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:14,299
much like you do in Alpha Beta search or
 

861
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:16,210
much like you do in Alpha Beta search or
want to crawl to research but with

862
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:16,220
want to crawl to research but with
 

863
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,890
want to crawl to research but with
different techniques so there's a

864
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:17,900
different techniques so there's a
 

865
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,720
different techniques so there's a
different search algorithm and then we

866
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:19,730
different search algorithm and then we
 

867
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,430
different search algorithm and then we
have to deal with the leaves differently

868
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
have to deal with the leaves differently
 

869
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,320
have to deal with the leaves differently
so if you think about what Lee brothers

870
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:23,330
so if you think about what Lee brothers
 

871
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,210
so if you think about what Lee brothers
did we didn't have to worry about this

872
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:25,220
did we didn't have to worry about this
 

873
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,340
did we didn't have to worry about this
because we only did it at the end of the

874
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,350
because we only did it at the end of the
 

875
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,030
because we only did it at the end of the
game so we would always terminate into a

876
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:31,040
game so we would always terminate into a
 

877
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,039
game so we would always terminate into a
real situation and we would know what to

878
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,049
real situation and we would know what to
 

879
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:35,080
real situation and we would know what to
payout this it didn't do this

880
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,090
payout this it didn't do this
 

881
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,510
payout this it didn't do this
depth limited loka heads but now in this

882
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
depth limited loka heads but now in this
 

883
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,390
depth limited loka heads but now in this
new paper which is called depth limited

884
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,400
new paper which is called depth limited
 

885
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,830
new paper which is called depth limited
I think it's called depth limited

886
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:41,840
I think it's called depth limited
 

887
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,510
I think it's called depth limited
research for imperfect information games

888
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
research for imperfect information games
 

889
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,539
research for imperfect information games
we can actually do sound depth limited

890
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:46,549
we can actually do sound depth limited
 

891
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:48,130
we can actually do sound depth limited
look at it so we can actually started

892
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:48,140
look at it so we can actually started
 

893
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,850
look at it so we can actually started
with a look ahead

894
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:48,860
with a look ahead
 

895
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,650
with a look ahead
from the beginning of the game on

896
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:50,660
from the beginning of the game on
 

897
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,710
from the beginning of the game on
because that's too complicated to do for

898
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:53,720
because that's too complicated to do for
 

899
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,789
because that's too complicated to do for
this whole long game

900
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:54,799
this whole long game
 

901
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,680
this whole long game
so in Lee brothers we were just doing it

902
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:56,690
so in Lee brothers we were just doing it
 

903
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,960
so in Lee brothers we were just doing it
for the end so and then the other side

904
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:58,970
for the end so and then the other side
 

905
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,390
for the end so and then the other side
this belief distribution so is it

906
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:01,400
this belief distribution so is it
 

907
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,169
this belief distribution so is it
explicitly modeled what kind of beliefs

908
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:05,179
explicitly modeled what kind of beliefs
 

909
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:08,409
explicitly modeled what kind of beliefs
that the opponent might have yeah yeah

910
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:08,419
that the opponent might have yeah yeah
 

911
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:10,810
that the opponent might have yeah yeah
it is explicitly modeled but it's not

912
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:10,820
it is explicitly modeled but it's not
 

913
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,720
it is explicitly modeled but it's not
assumed the beliefs are actually output

914
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:13,730
assumed the beliefs are actually output
 

915
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,080
assumed the beliefs are actually output
not input of course the starting beliefs

916
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,090
not input of course the starting beliefs
 

917
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,840
not input of course the starting beliefs
are input but they just fall from the

918
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:19,850
are input but they just fall from the
 

919
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,549
are input but they just fall from the
rules of the game because we know that

920
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:21,559
rules of the game because we know that
 

921
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:24,010
rules of the game because we know that
the dealer deals uniformly from the dick

922
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:24,020
the dealer deals uniformly from the dick
 

923
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,159
the dealer deals uniformly from the dick
so I know that every pair of cards that

924
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:27,169
so I know that every pair of cards that
 

925
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:30,610
so I know that every pair of cards that
you might have is equally likely I know

926
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:30,620
you might have is equally likely I know
 

927
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,510
you might have is equally likely I know
that for a fact

928
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:31,520
that for a fact
 

929
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,860
that for a fact
that's as follows from the rules of the

930
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:32,870
that's as follows from the rules of the
 

931
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,690
that's as follows from the rules of the
game of course except the two cards that

932
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:34,700
game of course except the two cards that
 

933
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,789
game of course except the two cards that
I have I know you don't have those yes

934
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
I have I know you don't have those yes
 

935
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,500
I have I know you don't have those yes
you have to take that into account

936
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:38,510
you have to take that into account
 

937
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,090
you have to take that into account
that's called card removal and that's

938
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:40,100
that's called card removal and that's
 

939
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,159
that's called card removal and that's
very important is the dealing always

940
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:42,169
very important is the dealing always
 

941
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:44,409
very important is the dealing always
coming from a single deck in the heads

942
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:44,419
coming from a single deck in the heads
 

943
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:48,070
coming from a single deck in the heads
up so you can assume single deck know

944
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,080
up so you can assume single deck know
 

945
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,620
up so you can assume single deck know
that if some if if I have the ace of

946
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:50,630
that if some if if I have the ace of
 

947
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,020
that if some if if I have the ace of
spades I know you don't have an ace of

948
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,030
spades I know you don't have an ace of

rock-paper-scissors so we can draw it as
 

1015
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,850
rock-paper-scissors so we can draw it as
player 1 moves first and then player 2

1016
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:20,860
player 1 moves first and then player 2
 

1017
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,910
player 1 moves first and then player 2
moves but of course it's important that

1018
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:23,920
moves but of course it's important that
 

1019
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,620
moves but of course it's important that
player 2 doesn't know what player 1

1020
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:25,630
player 2 doesn't know what player 1
 

1021
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,840
player 2 doesn't know what player 1
moved otherwise player 2 would win every

moved otherwise player 2 would win every
 

1023
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,700
moved otherwise player 2 would win every
time so we can draw that as an

time so we can draw that as an
 

1025
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,650
time so we can draw that as an

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,050
information set where player 1 makes one
of three moves first and then there's an

00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:34,060
of three moves first and then there's an
 

1029
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,630
of three moves first and then there's an
information set for player 2 so player 2

1030
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:36,640
information set for player 2 so player 2
 

1031
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,110
information set for player 2 so player 2

they wanted 1/3 wants it though so Bayes
gives you that basis you but is that

gives you that basis you but is that
specific to a particular player or is it

1053
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,020
with the game theory isn't really player
specific so that's what also why we

specific so that's what also why we
 

1055
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,360

rationality so we just think the AI just
 

1065
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,640
rationality so we just think the AI just

1071
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,470
were right I am rational and that that's
that's the idea of game theory so it's

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:31,480
that's the idea of game theory so it's
 

1073
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,690
that's the idea of game theory so it's

holes to exploit and they're world's
leading experts in counter exploitation

1104
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:06,470
leading experts in counter exploitation
 

1105
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,289
leading experts in counter exploitation
so I decided that we're not gonna turn

1106
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:08,299
so I decided that we're not gonna turn
 

1107
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,149
so I decided that we're not gonna turn
that stuff on actually I saw a few

1108
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:10,159
that stuff on actually I saw a few
 

1109
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,489
that stuff on actually I saw a few
papers exploiting opponents it sound

1110
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:12,499
papers exploiting opponents it sound
 

1111
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:16,180
papers exploiting opponents it sound
very interesting to explore do you think

1112
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,190
very interesting to explore do you think
 

1113
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,279
very interesting to explore do you think
there's room for exploitation generally

1114
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:18,289
there's room for exploitation generally
 

1115
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:21,450
there's room for exploitation generally
outside of LeBron us is is there subject

1116
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:21,460
outside of LeBron us is is there subject
 

1117
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,580
outside of LeBron us is is there subject
or people differences that could be

1118
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:24,590
or people differences that could be
 

1119
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,299
or people differences that could be
exploited maybe not just in poker but in

1120
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:28,309
exploited maybe not just in poker but in
 

1121
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,580
exploited maybe not just in poker but in
general interactions negotiations all

1122
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:30,590
general interactions negotiations all
 

1123
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,560
general interactions negotiations all
these other domains that yours

1124
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:32,570
these other domains that yours
 

1125
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,080
these other domains that yours
considering yeah I definitely we've done

1126
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,090
considering yeah I definitely we've done
 

1127
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,999
considering yeah I definitely we've done
some work on that and I really like

1128
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:37,009
some work on that and I really like
 

1129
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:40,060
some work on that and I really like
their work at hybridize is the two so

1130
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,070
their work at hybridize is the two so
 

1131
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,609
their work at hybridize is the two so
you figure out what would a rational

1132
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:42,619
you figure out what would a rational
 

1133
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:44,409
you figure out what would a rational
opponent do and by the way that's safe

1134
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:44,419
opponent do and by the way that's safe
 

1135
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:46,659
opponent do and by the way that's safe
in these zero-sum games two player

1136
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:46,669
in these zero-sum games two player
 

1137
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:48,340
in these zero-sum games two player
zero-sum games because if the opponent

1138
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:48,350
zero-sum games because if the opponent
 

1139
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,080
zero-sum games because if the opponent
does something irrational yes it might

1140
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,090
does something irrational yes it might
 

1141
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,399
does something irrational yes it might
show throw off my beliefs but the amount

1142
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:54,409
show throw off my beliefs but the amount
 

1143
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:56,529
show throw off my beliefs but the amount
that the player can gain by throwing off

1144
00:23:56,529 --> 00:23:56,539
that the player can gain by throwing off
 

1145
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:59,680
that the player can gain by throwing off
my belief is always less than they lose

1146
00:23:59,680 --> 00:23:59,690
my belief is always less than they lose
 

1147
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,299
my belief is always less than they lose
by playing poorly so so it's safe but

1148
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:03,309
by playing poorly so so it's safe but
 

1149
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,849
by playing poorly so so it's safe but
still if somebody's weak as a player you

1150
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:06,859
still if somebody's weak as a player you
 

1151
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,349
still if somebody's weak as a player you
might want to play differently to

1152
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:08,359
might want to play differently to
 

1153
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,989
might want to play differently to
exploit them more so that you can think

1154
00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:10,999
exploit them more so that you can think
 

1155
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:12,580
exploit them more so that you can think
about it this way a game theoretic

1156
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:12,590
about it this way a game theoretic
 

1157
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:17,220
about it this way a game theoretic
strategies are unbeatable but it doesn't

1158
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,230
strategies are unbeatable but it doesn't
 

1159
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,259
strategies are unbeatable but it doesn't
maximally beat the other opponent so the

1160
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:20,269
maximally beat the other opponent so the
 

1161
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:23,019
maximally beat the other opponent so the
winnings per hand might be better with a

1162
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:23,029
winnings per hand might be better with a
 

1163
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:25,090
winnings per hand might be better with a
different strategy and the hybrid is

1164
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:25,100
different strategy and the hybrid is
 

1165
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,349
different strategy and the hybrid is
that you start from a game theoretic

1166
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:26,359
that you start from a game theoretic
 

1167
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:28,899
that you start from a game theoretic
approach and then as you gain data from

1168
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:28,909
approach and then as you gain data from
 

1169
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:31,690
approach and then as you gain data from
about the opponent in certain parts of

1170
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:31,700
about the opponent in certain parts of
 

1171
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,580
about the opponent in certain parts of
the game tree that in those parts of the

1172
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:33,590
the game tree that in those parts of the
 

1173
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,009
the game tree that in those parts of the
game tree you start to tweak your

1174
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:36,019
game tree you start to tweak your
 

1175
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:38,139
game tree you start to tweak your
strategy more and more towards

1176
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:38,149
strategy more and more towards
 

1177
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:40,690
strategy more and more towards
exploitation while still staying fairly

1178
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:40,700
exploitation while still staying fairly
 

1179
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,340
exploitation while still staying fairly
close to the game theoretic strategy so

1180
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,350
close to the game theoretic strategy so
 

1181
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,349
close to the game theoretic strategy so
as to not open yourself up to

1182
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:44,359
as to not open yourself up to
 

1183
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,830
as to not open yourself up to
exploitation too much

1184
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:46,840
exploitation too much
 

1185
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,299
exploitation too much
how do you do that do you try to vary up

1186
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:51,309
how do you do that do you try to vary up
 

1187
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:53,789
how do you do that do you try to vary up
strategies make it unpredictable it's

1188
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:53,799
strategies make it unpredictable it's
 

1189
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,070
strategies make it unpredictable it's
like what is it

1190
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,080
like what is it
 

1191
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,830
like what is it
tit-for-tat strategies in prisoner's

1192
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:58,840
tit-for-tat strategies in prisoner's
 

1193
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,159
tit-for-tat strategies in prisoner's
dilemma or well it doesn't that that's a

1194
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:02,169
dilemma or well it doesn't that that's a
 

1195
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,889
dilemma or well it doesn't that that's a
repeated game kind of prisoner's dilemma

1196
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:04,899
repeated game kind of prisoner's dilemma
 

1197
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:07,379
repeated game kind of prisoner's dilemma
repeats it games but but even there

1198
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:07,389
repeats it games but but even there
 

1199
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:09,029
repeats it games but but even there
there's no proof that says that that's

1200
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,039
there's no proof that says that that's
 

1201
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,279
there's no proof that says that that's
the best thing but experimentally it

1202
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:11,289
the best thing but experimentally it
 

1203
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:13,590
the best thing but experimentally it
actually does does does well so what

1204
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
actually does does does well so what
 

1205
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,360
actually does does does well so what
kind of games are there first of all I

1206
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,370
kind of games are there first of all I
 

1207
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,310
kind of games are there first of all I
don't know if this is something that you

1208
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:17,320
don't know if this is something that you
 

1209
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,379
don't know if this is something that you
could just summarize there's perfect

1210
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:19,389
could just summarize there's perfect
 

1211
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:20,759
could just summarize there's perfect
information games or all the

1212
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:20,769
information games or all the
 

1213
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,029
information games or all the
informations on the table there is

1214
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039
informations on the table there is
 

1215
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,619
informations on the table there is
imperfect information games there's

1216
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:25,629
imperfect information games there's
 

1217
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:28,379
imperfect information games there's
repeated games you play over and over

1218
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:28,389
repeated games you play over and over
 

1219
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:32,909
repeated games you play over and over
there's zero-sum games there's

1220
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:32,919
there's zero-sum games there's
 

1221
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:35,879
there's zero-sum games there's
nonzero-sum games yeah and then there's

1222
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:35,889
nonzero-sum games yeah and then there's
 

1223
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:37,710
nonzero-sum games yeah and then there's
a really important distinction you're

1224
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:37,720
a really important distinction you're
 

1225
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,889
a really important distinction you're
making two-player versus more players so

1226
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:40,899
making two-player versus more players so
 

1227
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:44,909
making two-player versus more players so
what are what other games out there and

1228
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:44,919
what are what other games out there and
 

1229
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:46,320
what are what other games out there and
what's the difference for example with

1230
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,330
what's the difference for example with
 

1231
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,230
what's the difference for example with
this two-player game versus more players

1232
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:49,240
this two-player game versus more players
 

1233
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,330
this two-player game versus more players
yeah what are the key differences right

1234
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:51,340
yeah what are the key differences right
 

1235
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,570
yeah what are the key differences right
here so let me start from the the basic

1236
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:54,580
here so let me start from the the basic
 

1237
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,580
here so let me start from the the basic
so a repeated game is a game where the

1238
00:25:59,580 --> 00:25:59,590
so a repeated game is a game where the
 

1239
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,119
so a repeated game is a game where the
same exact game is played over and over

1240
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:02,129
same exact game is played over and over
 

1241
00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:06,359
same exact game is played over and over
in these extensive form games where

1242
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:06,369
in these extensive form games where
 

1243
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:08,759
in these extensive form games where
think about three form maybe with these

1244
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:08,769
think about three form maybe with these
 

1245
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,799
think about three form maybe with these
information says to represent incomplete

1246
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:10,809
information says to represent incomplete
 

1247
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:14,159
information says to represent incomplete
information you can have kind of

1248
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:14,169
information you can have kind of
 

1249
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:16,590
information you can have kind of
repetitive interactions even repeated

1250
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:16,600
repetitive interactions even repeated
 

1251
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,239
repetitive interactions even repeated
games are a special case of that by the

1252
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:18,249
games are a special case of that by the
 

1253
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:21,450
games are a special case of that by the
way but if the game doesn't have to be

1254
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:21,460
way but if the game doesn't have to be
 

1255
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,430
way but if the game doesn't have to be
exactly the same selectively sourcing

1256
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
exactly the same selectively sourcing
 

1257
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,499
exactly the same selectively sourcing
all trips yes we kind of see it the same

1258
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:25,509
all trips yes we kind of see it the same
 

1259
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:27,869
all trips yes we kind of see it the same
supply base year to year but what I'm

1260
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:27,879
supply base year to year but what I'm
 

1261
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,430
supply base year to year but what I'm
buying is a little different every time

1262
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,440
buying is a little different every time
 

1263
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,960
buying is a little different every time
and the supply base is a little

1264
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:30,970
and the supply base is a little
 

1265
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,789
and the supply base is a little
different every time and so on so it's

1266
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:32,799
different every time and so on so it's
 

1267
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,249
different every time and so on so it's
not really repeated so to find a purely

1268
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:35,259
not really repeated so to find a purely
 

1269
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:37,739
not really repeated so to find a purely
repeated game is actually very rare in

1270
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:37,749
repeated game is actually very rare in
 

1271
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:40,340
repeated game is actually very rare in
the world so they're really a very

1272
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:40,350
the world so they're really a very
 

1273
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,249
the world so they're really a very
coarse model of what's going on then if

1274
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:44,259
coarse model of what's going on then if
 

1275
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:46,769
coarse model of what's going on then if
you move up from repeat just repeated

1276
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:46,779
you move up from repeat just repeated
 

1277
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:50,310
you move up from repeat just repeated
simple repeated matrix games not all the

1278
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
simple repeated matrix games not all the
 

1279
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,840
simple repeated matrix games not all the
way to extensive form games but in

1280
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:51,850
way to extensive form games but in
 

1281
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,259
way to extensive form games but in
between

1282
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:52,269
between
 

1283
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:55,409
between
they're stochastic games where you know

1284
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:55,419
they're stochastic games where you know
 

1285
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:59,159
they're stochastic games where you know
this these think about it like these

1286
00:26:59,159 --> 00:26:59,169
this these think about it like these
 

1287
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:00,390
this these think about it like these
little matrix games

1288
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400
little matrix games
 

1289
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,730
little matrix games
and when you take an action and your

1290
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:02,740
and when you take an action and your
 

1291
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,310
and when you take an action and your
home takes an action they determine not

1292
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:05,320
home takes an action they determine not
 

1293
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,130
home takes an action they determine not
which next state I'm going to next game

1294
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,140
which next state I'm going to next game
 

1295
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,200
which next state I'm going to next game
I'm going to but the distribution over

1296
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,210
I'm going to but the distribution over
 

1297
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,200
I'm going to but the distribution over
next games where I might be going to so

1298
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,210
next games where I might be going to so
 

1299
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,660
next games where I might be going to so
so that's the stochastic game but it's

1300
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:15,670
so that's the stochastic game but it's
 

1301
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,180
so that's the stochastic game but it's
like matrix games repeated stochastic

1302
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:18,190
like matrix games repeated stochastic
 

1303
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,600
like matrix games repeated stochastic
games extensive form games that is from

1305
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,840

1307
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,790
less to more general and and poker is an
example of the last one so it's really

1308
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:26,800
example of the last one so it's really
 

1309
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,270
example of the last one so it's really
the most general setting extensive form

1310
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:30,280
the most general setting extensive form
 

1311

1313
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,799

can you describe extensive form games

1320
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:39,520
can you describe extensive form games
 

1321
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,299
can you describe extensive form games
what was the motto here yeah so if you

1322
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:42,309
what was the motto here yeah so if you
 

1323
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:44,610
what was the motto here yeah so if you
imagine with the tree form so it's

1324
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:44,620
imagine with the tree form so it's
 

1325
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,230
imagine with the tree form so it's
really the tree form like in chess

1326
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:46,240
really the tree form like in chess
 

1327
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,990
really the tree form like in chess
there's a search tree versus a matrix is

1328
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,000
there's a search tree versus a matrix is
 

1329
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,810
there's a search tree versus a matrix is
a matrix yeah and that's the new matrix

1330
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:51,820
a matrix yeah and that's the new matrix
 

1331
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,549
a matrix yeah and that's the new matrix
is called the matrix form or by matrix

1332
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:53,559
is called the matrix form or by matrix
 

1333
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:56,250
is called the matrix form or by matrix
form or normal form game and here you

1334
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:56,260
form or normal form game and here you
 

1335
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,540
form or normal form game and here you
have the tree form so you can actually

1336
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:57,550
have the tree form so you can actually
 

1337
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,330
have the tree form so you can actually
do certain types of reasoning there that

1338
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:00,340
do certain types of reasoning there that
 

1339
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,850
do certain types of reasoning there that
you'll lose the information when you go

1340
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:02,860
you'll lose the information when you go
 

1341
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,150
you'll lose the information when you go
to normal form there's a certain form of

1342
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:06,160
to normal form there's a certain form of
 

1343
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,950
to normal form there's a certain form of
equivalence like if you go from three

1344
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:07,960
equivalence like if you go from three
 

1345
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,540
equivalence like if you go from three
form and you say it every possible

1346
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:09,550
form and you say it every possible
 

1347
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:13,169
form and you say it every possible
contingency plan is the strategy then I

1348
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:13,179
contingency plan is the strategy then I
 

1349
00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:14,700
contingency plan is the strategy then I
can actually go back to the normal form

1350
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:14,710
can actually go back to the normal form
 

1351
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,770
can actually go back to the normal form
but I lose some information from the

1352
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:16,780
but I lose some information from the
 

1353
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,960
but I lose some information from the
lack of sequentiality then the

1354
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:18,970
lack of sequentiality then the
 

1355
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,490
lack of sequentiality then the
multiplayer versus two-player

1356
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:20,500
multiplayer versus two-player
 

1357
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,860
multiplayer versus two-player
distinction is an important one

1358
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:22,870
distinction is an important one
 

1359
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:28,100
distinction is an important one
so two-player games in zero-sum are

1360
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,110
so two-player games in zero-sum are
 

1361
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:32,250
so two-player games in zero-sum are
conceptually easier and computationally

1362
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:32,260
conceptually easier and computationally
 

1363
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,740
conceptually easier and computationally
easier there's still huge like this one

1364
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:34,750
easier there's still huge like this one
 

1365
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,560
easier there's still huge like this one
this one but they're conceptually easier

1366
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,570
this one but they're conceptually easier
 

1367
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,960
this one but they're conceptually easier
and computationally easier in that

1368
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:39,970
and computationally easier in that
 

1369
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,880
and computationally easier in that
conceptually you don't have to worry

1370
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:41,890
conceptually you don't have to worry
 

1371
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,280
conceptually you don't have to worry
about which equilibrium is the other guy

1372
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,290
about which equilibrium is the other guy
 

1373
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,930
about which equilibrium is the other guy
going to play when there are multiple

1374
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:45,940
going to play when there are multiple
 

1375
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,049
going to play when there are multiple
because any equilibrium strategy is a

1376
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:49,059
because any equilibrium strategy is a
 

1377
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:50,820
because any equilibrium strategy is a
best response to any other equilibrium

1378
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:50,830
best response to any other equilibrium
 

1379
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,830
best response to any other equilibrium
strategy so I can play a different

1380
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:52,840
strategy so I can play a different
 

1381
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,080
strategy so I can play a different
equilibrium from you and we'll still get

1382
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,090
equilibrium from you and we'll still get
 

1383
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,690
equilibrium from you and we'll still get
the right values of the game that falls

1384
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:57,700
the right values of the game that falls
 

1385
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,400
the right values of the game that falls
apart even with two players when you

1386
00:28:59,400 --> 00:28:59,410
apart even with two players when you
 

1387
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,799
apart even with two players when you
have general some games even without

1388
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:01,809
have general some games even without
 

1389
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:03,570
have general some games even without
cooperation just even without

1390
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:03,580
cooperation just even without
 

1391
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,270
cooperation just even without
cooperation so there's a big gap from

1392
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:06,280
cooperation so there's a big gap from
 

1393
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,160
cooperation so there's a big gap from
two player zero-sum to two-player

1394
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,170
two player zero-sum to two-player
 

1395
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,200
two player zero-sum to two-player
general sum or even to three player

1396
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,210
general sum or even to three player
 

1397
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,770
general sum or even to three player
zero-sum that's that's a big gap

1398
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:12,780
zero-sum that's that's a big gap
 

1399
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,490
zero-sum that's that's a big gap
at least in theory can you maybe not

1400
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:16,500
at least in theory can you maybe not
 

1401
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,950
at least in theory can you maybe not
mathematically provide the intuition why

1402
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:18,960
mathematically provide the intuition why
 

1403
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,570
mathematically provide the intuition why
it all falls apart with three or more

1404
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:20,580
it all falls apart with three or more
 

1405
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,390
it all falls apart with three or more
players it seems like you should still

1406
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:23,400
players it seems like you should still
 

1407
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,560
players it seems like you should still
be able to have a Nash equilibrium that

1408
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:26,570
be able to have a Nash equilibrium that
 

1409
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:31,520
be able to have a Nash equilibrium that
yeah that's instructive that holds okay

1410
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:31,530
yeah that's instructive that holds okay
 

1411
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:36,140
yeah that's instructive that holds okay
so it is true that all finite games have

1412
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,150
so it is true that all finite games have
 

1413
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,960
so it is true that all finite games have
a Nash equilibrium so this is what your

1414
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:38,970
a Nash equilibrium so this is what your
 

1415
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,720
a Nash equilibrium so this is what your
Nash actually proved so they do have a

1416
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:41,730
Nash actually proved so they do have a
 

1417
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,790
Nash actually proved so they do have a
Nash equilibrium that's not a problem

1418
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:43,800
Nash equilibrium that's not a problem
 

1419
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,560
Nash equilibrium that's not a problem
the problem is that there can be many

1420
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:45,570
the problem is that there can be many
 

1421
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,320
the problem is that there can be many
and then there's a question of which

1422
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:48,330
and then there's a question of which
 

1423
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:51,080
and then there's a question of which
equilibrium to select so and if you

1424
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,090
equilibrium to select so and if you
 

1425
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,790
equilibrium to select so and if you
select your strategy from a different

1426
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:52,800
select your strategy from a different
 

1427
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,280
select your strategy from a different
equilibrium and I select mind then did

1428
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,290
equilibrium and I select mind then did
 

1429
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,740
equilibrium and I select mind then did
what does that mean I and in this non

00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:00,750
what does that mean I and in this non

zero sum games we may lose some joint

1432
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:04,740
zero sum games we may lose some joint

stupid we could actually both be better

1436
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,040

like collusion that maybe you and I can

1442
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:14,790
like collusion that maybe you and I can
 

1443
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:18,140
like collusion that maybe you and I can
get up on a third player and we can do

1444
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,150
get up on a third player and we can do
 

1445
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,120
get up on a third player and we can do
radically better by colluding so that

1446
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,130
radically better by colluding so that
 

1447
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,410
radically better by colluding so that
there are lots of issues that come up

1448
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:21,420
there are lots of issues that come up
 

1449
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:21,890
there are lots of issues that come up
there

so no Brown student you workers on this

1452
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,080
so no Brown student you workers on this

00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,050
has mentioned I looked through the AMA
 

1455
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,110
has mentioned I looked through the AMA
and read it he mentioned that the

00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,120
and read it he mentioned that the
 

1457
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,970
and read it he mentioned that the
ability of poker players to collaborate

1458
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:31,980
ability of poker players to collaborate
 

1459
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,280
ability of poker players to collaborate
will make the game he was asked the

00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,290
will make the game he was asked the
 

1461
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,170
will make the game he was asked the
question of how would you make the game

1462
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:36,180
question of how would you make the game
 

1463
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,960
question of how would you make the game
of poker or both of you were asked the

methods and he said that there's not

1472
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:48,750
methods and he said that there's not
 

1473
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,420
methods and he said that there's not
many ways of making poker more difficult

1474
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:52,430
many ways of making poker more difficult
 

1475
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,480
many ways of making poker more difficult
but collaboration or cooperation between

1476
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:56,490
but collaboration or cooperation between
 

1477
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,730
but collaboration or cooperation between
players would make it extremely

1478
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:58,740
players would make it extremely
 

1479
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,620
players would make it extremely
difficult so can you provide the

1480
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:00,630
difficult so can you provide the
 

1481
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,710
difficult so can you provide the
intuition behind why that is if you

1482
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:03,720
intuition behind why that is if you
 

1483
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,220
intuition behind why that is if you
agree with that idea yeah so we've done

1484
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,230
agree with that idea yeah so we've done
 

1485
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,490
agree with that idea yeah so we've done
a lot of work coalitional games and we

1486
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:10,500
a lot of work coalitional games and we
 

1487
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,440
a lot of work coalitional games and we
actually have a paper here with my other

1488
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:12,450
actually have a paper here with my other
 

1489
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,000
actually have a paper here with my other
student cappella Farina and some other

00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:18,180
actually just came back from the poster

00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:21,420
session where we present life so when
 

1497
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,640
session where we present life so when
you have a collusion it's a it's a

1498
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:22,650
you have a collusion it's a it's a
 

1499
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,440
you have a collusion it's a it's a
different problem yes and it typically

1500
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:24,450
different problem yes and it typically
 

1501
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,040
different problem yes and it typically
gets even harder then

1502
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,050
gets even harder then
 

1503
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,890
gets even harder then
even the game representations some of

1504
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:29,900
even the game representations some of
 

1505
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,720
even the game representations some of
the game representations don't really

1506
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:31,730
the game representations don't really
 

1507
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,810
the game representations don't really
allow go to computation so we actually

1508
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:34,820
allow go to computation so we actually
 

1509
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,810
allow go to computation so we actually
introduced a new game representation for

1510
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:37,820
introduced a new game representation for
 

1511
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,820
introduced a new game representation for
for that is that kind of cooperation

1512
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:39,830
for that is that kind of cooperation
 

1513
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,970
for that is that kind of cooperation
part of the model is are you do you have

1514
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:42,980
part of the model is are you do you have
 

1515
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,100
part of the model is are you do you have
do you have information about the fact

1516
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,110
do you have information about the fact
 

1517
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,290
do you have information about the fact
that other players are cooperating or is

1518
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:47,300
that other players are cooperating or is
 

1519
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,450
that other players are cooperating or is
it just this chaos that where nothing is

1520
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:49,460
it just this chaos that where nothing is
 

1521
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,430
it just this chaos that where nothing is
known so there's some something's

1522
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,440
known so there's some something's
 

1523
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,530
known so there's some something's
unknown can you give an example of a

1524
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:53,540
unknown can you give an example of a
 

1525
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,950
unknown can you give an example of a
collusion type game or Z you select

1526
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:56,960
collusion type game or Z you select
 

1527
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,770
collusion type game or Z you select
breach that so think about bridge it's

1528
00:31:59,770 --> 00:31:59,780
breach that so think about bridge it's
 

1529
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,480
breach that so think about bridge it's
like when you and I are on a team

1530
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:01,490
like when you and I are on a team
 

1531
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,990
like when you and I are on a team
our payoffs are the same the problem is

1532
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,000
our payoffs are the same the problem is
 

1533
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,540
our payoffs are the same the problem is
that we can't talk so so when I get my

1534
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:07,550
that we can't talk so so when I get my
 

1535
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,280
that we can't talk so so when I get my
cards I can't whisper to you what my

1536
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,290
cards I can't whisper to you what my
 

1537
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,330
cards I can't whisper to you what my
cards are that would not be allowed so

1538
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:12,340
cards are that would not be allowed so
 

1539
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,340
cards are that would not be allowed so
we have to somehow coordinate our

1540
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,350
we have to somehow coordinate our
 

1541
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,090
we have to somehow coordinate our
strategies ahead of time and only ahead

1542
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,100
strategies ahead of time and only ahead
 

1543
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,980
strategies ahead of time and only ahead
of time and then there are certain

1544
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:20,990
of time and then there are certain
 

1545
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,260
of time and then there are certain
signals we can talk about but they have

1546
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:23,270
signals we can talk about but they have
 

1547
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,390
signals we can talk about but they have
to be such that the other team also

1548
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:25,400
to be such that the other team also
 

1549
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,030
to be such that the other team also
understands them so so that that's

1550
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,040
understands them so so that that's
 

1551
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,070
understands them so so that that's
that's an example where the coordination

1552
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,080
that's an example where the coordination
 

1553
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,260
that's an example where the coordination
is already built into the rules of the

is already built into the rules of the
 

1555

game but in many other situations like
 

1557
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:38,340

strategy that like that you're willing
 

1571
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,400
strategy that like that you're willing
to do and not willing to do those kinds

1572
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,410
to do and not willing to do those kinds
 

1573
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,760
to do and not willing to do those kinds
of things so how do you start to now

1574
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:00,770
of things so how do you start to now
 

1575
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,440
of things so how do you start to now

poker into other applications like

1578
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:04,640
poker into other applications like
 

1579
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,370
poker into other applications like
negotiations how do you start applying

1580
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:06,380
negotiations how do you start applying
 

1581
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,460

00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:11,900
yeah even real world domains that you've
 

1585
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,510
yeah even real world domains that you've
worked on yeah I actually have two

1586
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:13,520
worked on yeah I actually have two

applications I think you worked a little

1610
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:44,990
applications I think you worked a little
 

1611
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:51,250

optimized markets optimized but that's

1618
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,100
optimized markets optimized but that's
 

1619
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,490

much more about a combinatorial market

1620
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:00,500
much more about a combinatorial market
 

1621
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,010
much more about a combinatorial market
and optimization based technology that's

1622
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,020
and optimization based technology that's
 

1623
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,890
and optimization based technology that's
not using these game theoretic reasoning

1624
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:05,900
not using these game theoretic reasoning
 

1625
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,540
not using these game theoretic reasoning
technologies I think okay so what sort

1626
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:10,550
technologies I think okay so what sort
 

1627
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,240
technologies I think okay so what sort
of high level do you think about our

1628
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,250
of high level do you think about our
 

1629
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,420
of high level do you think about our
ability to use game theoretic concepts

1630
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:16,430
ability to use game theoretic concepts
 

1631
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,060
ability to use game theoretic concepts
to model human behavior do you think do

1632
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,070
to model human behavior do you think do
 

1633
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,160
to model human behavior do you think do
you think human behavior is amenable to

1634
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:21,170
you think human behavior is amenable to
 

1635
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,860
you think human behavior is amenable to
this kind of modeling so outside of the

1636
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:23,870
this kind of modeling so outside of the
 

1637
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,690
this kind of modeling so outside of the
poker games and where have you seen it

1638
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:25,700
poker games and where have you seen it
 

1639
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,940
poker games and where have you seen it
done successfully in your work I'm not

1640
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:27,950
done successfully in your work I'm not
 

1641
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:32,850
done successfully in your work I'm not
sure the goal really is modeling humans

1642
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:32,860
sure the goal really is modeling humans
 

1643
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,170
sure the goal really is modeling humans
like for example if I'm playing a

1644
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:35,180
like for example if I'm playing a
 

1645
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,840
like for example if I'm playing a
zero-sum game yes I don't really care

1646
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:37,850
zero-sum game yes I don't really care
 

1647
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,540
zero-sum game yes I don't really care
that the opponent is actually following

1648
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:40,550
that the opponent is actually following
 

1649
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,420
that the opponent is actually following
my model of rational behavior because if

1650
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:43,430
my model of rational behavior because if
 

1651
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,760
my model of rational behavior because if
they're not that's even better for me

1652
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:45,770
they're not that's even better for me
 

1653
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,330
they're not that's even better for me
right so so they see with the opponents

1654
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:49,340
right so so they see with the opponents
 

1655
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,300
right so so they see with the opponents
and games there's a the prerequisite is

1656
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:52,310
and games there's a the prerequisite is
 

1657
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:57,220
and games there's a the prerequisite is
that you've formalized the interaction

1658
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,230
that you've formalized the interaction
 

1659
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,380
that you've formalized the interaction
in some way that can be amenable to

1660
00:34:59,380 --> 00:34:59,390
in some way that can be amenable to
 

1661
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,650
in some way that can be amenable to
analysis and you've done this amazing

1662
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:02,660
analysis and you've done this amazing
 

1663
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,720
analysis and you've done this amazing
work with mechanism design designing

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:04,730
work with mechanism design designing

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:10,970
games that have certain outcomes but so

games that have certain outcomes but so
I'll tell you an example for my for my

1668
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:13,190
I'll tell you an example for my for my
 

1669
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,580
I'll tell you an example for my for my
world of autonomous vehicles right we're

1670
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:15,590
world of autonomous vehicles right we're
 

1671
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,340
world of autonomous vehicles right we're
studying pedestrians and pedestrians and

1672
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:18,350
studying pedestrians and pedestrians and
 

1673
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,980
studying pedestrians and pedestrians and
cars negotiating this nonverbal

1674
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:20,990
cars negotiating this nonverbal
 

1675
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,200
cars negotiating this nonverbal
communication there's this weird and

1676
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,210
communication there's this weird and
 

1677
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:26,050
communication there's this weird and
game dance of tension where pedestrians

1678
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:26,060
game dance of tension where pedestrians
 

1679
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,000
game dance of tension where pedestrians
are basically saying I trusted you won't

1680
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,010
are basically saying I trusted you won't
 

1681
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,760
are basically saying I trusted you won't
kill me and so as a jaywalker I will

1682
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:30,770
kill me and so as a jaywalker I will
 

1683
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,170
kill me and so as a jaywalker I will
step onto the road even though I'm

1684
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:32,180
step onto the road even though I'm
 

1685
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,250
step onto the road even though I'm
breaking the law and there's this

1686
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:33,260
breaking the law and there's this
 

1687
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,250
breaking the law and there's this
tension and the question is we really

1688
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:36,260
tension and the question is we really
 

1689
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,530
tension and the question is we really
don't know how to model that well in

1690
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:38,540
don't know how to model that well in
 

1691
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,470
don't know how to model that well in
trying to model intent and so people

1692
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:41,480
trying to model intent and so people
 

1693
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,810
trying to model intent and so people
sometimes bring up ideas of game theory

1694
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:43,820
sometimes bring up ideas of game theory
 

1695
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,860
sometimes bring up ideas of game theory
and so on do you think that aspect of

1696
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:46,870
and so on do you think that aspect of
 

1697
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:50,020
and so on do you think that aspect of
human behavior can use these kinds of

1698
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,030
human behavior can use these kinds of
 

1699
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,560
human behavior can use these kinds of
imperfect information approaches

1700
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:52,570
imperfect information approaches
 

1701
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,920
imperfect information approaches
modeling

1702
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:53,930
modeling
 

1703
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,200
modeling
how do we how do you start to attack a

1704
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,210
how do we how do you start to attack a
 

1705
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,720
how do we how do you start to attack a
problem like that when you don't even

1706
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:58,730
problem like that when you don't even
 

1707
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,030
problem like that when you don't even
know how the game design the game to

1708
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,040
know how the game design the game to
 

1709
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,730
know how the game design the game to
describe the situation in order to solve

1710
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:03,740
describe the situation in order to solve
 

1711
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,380
describe the situation in order to solve
it okay so I haven't really thought

1712
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:05,390
it okay so I haven't really thought
 

1713
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,230
it okay so I haven't really thought
about jaywalking but one thing that I

1714
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,240
about jaywalking but one thing that I
 

1715
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,960
about jaywalking but one thing that I
think could be a good application in an

1716
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:10,970
think could be a good application in an
 

1717
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,180
think could be a good application in an
autonomous vehicles is the following so

1718
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,190
autonomous vehicles is the following so
 

1719
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,250
autonomous vehicles is the following so
let's say that you have fleets of

1720
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:15,260
let's say that you have fleets of
 

1721
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,170
let's say that you have fleets of
autonomous cars operated by different

1722
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:17,180
autonomous cars operated by different
 

1723
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,630
autonomous cars operated by different
companies so maybe here's the way more

1724
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:19,640
companies so maybe here's the way more
 

1725
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,329
companies so maybe here's the way more
fleet and here's the uber fleet if you

1726
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:22,339
fleet and here's the uber fleet if you
 

1727
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:24,400
fleet and here's the uber fleet if you
think about the rules of the road they

1728
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:24,410
think about the rules of the road they
 

1729
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,740
think about the rules of the road they
define certain little rules but that

1730
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:26,750
define certain little rules but that
 

1731
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,710
define certain little rules but that
still leaves a huge strategy space open

1732
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:29,720
still leaves a huge strategy space open
 

1733
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,930
still leaves a huge strategy space open
like as a simple example when cars merge

1734
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:31,940
like as a simple example when cars merge
 

1735
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,030
like as a simple example when cars merge
you know how he must merge you know they

1736
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:34,040
you know how he must merge you know they
 

1737
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,720
you know how he must merge you know they
slow down and look at each other and try

1738
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:37,730
slow down and look at each other and try
 

1739
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,849
slow down and look at each other and try
to I try to merge wouldn't it be better

1740
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:39,859
to I try to merge wouldn't it be better
 

1741
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:41,910
to I try to merge wouldn't it be better
if these situations would all repeat

1742
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:41,920
if these situations would all repeat
 

1743
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,380
if these situations would all repeat
pre-negotiated so we can actually merge

1744
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:44,390
pre-negotiated so we can actually merge
 

1745
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,210
pre-negotiated so we can actually merge
at full speed and we know that this is

1746
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:46,220
at full speed and we know that this is
 

1747
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,549
at full speed and we know that this is
the situation this is how we do it and

1748
00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:48,559
the situation this is how we do it and
 

1749
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:50,980
the situation this is how we do it and
it's all gonna be faster but there are

1750
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:50,990
it's all gonna be faster but there are
 

1751
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,990
it's all gonna be faster but there are
way too many situations to negotiate

1752
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,000
way too many situations to negotiate
 

1753
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,540
way too many situations to negotiate
manually so you could do use automated

1754
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:55,550
manually so you could do use automated
 

1755
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,190
manually so you could do use automated
negotiation this is the idea at least

1756
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,200
negotiation this is the idea at least
 

1757
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,920
negotiation this is the idea at least
you could use automated negotiation to

1758
00:36:59,920 --> 00:36:59,930
you could use automated negotiation to
 

1759
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,140
you could use automated negotiation to
negotiate all of these situations or

1760
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,150
negotiate all of these situations or
 

1761
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,900
negotiate all of these situations or
many of them in advance and of course it

1762
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:04,910
many of them in advance and of course it
 

1763
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,480
many of them in advance and of course it
might be that hey maybe you're not gonna

1764
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:07,490
might be that hey maybe you're not gonna
 

1765
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,829
might be that hey maybe you're not gonna
always let me go first

1766
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:08,839
always let me go first
 

1767
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:10,690
always let me go first
maybe you said okay well in these

1768
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:10,700
maybe you said okay well in these
 

1769
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,970
maybe you said okay well in these
situations all let you go first but in

1770
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:12,980
situations all let you go first but in
 

1771
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,470
situations all let you go first but in
exchange you're gonna give me - how much

1772
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:14,480
exchange you're gonna give me - how much
 

1773
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,329
exchange you're gonna give me - how much
you're gonna let me go first in this

1774
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:16,339
you're gonna let me go first in this
 

1775
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:17,170
you're gonna let me go first in this
situation yes

1776
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:17,180
situation yes
 

1777
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,059
situation yes
so it's this huge combinatorial

1778
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:19,069
so it's this huge combinatorial
 

1779
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:22,089
so it's this huge combinatorial
negotiation and do you think there's

1780
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:22,099
negotiation and do you think there's
 

1781
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:24,700
negotiation and do you think there's
room in that example of merging to model

1782
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:24,710
room in that example of merging to model
 

1783
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,319
room in that example of merging to model
this whole situation is an imperfect

1784
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:26,329
this whole situation is an imperfect
 

1785
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:28,000
this whole situation is an imperfect
information game or do you really want

1786
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,010
information game or do you really want
 

1787
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,460
information game or do you really want
to consider it to be a perfect no that's

1788
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:30,470
to consider it to be a perfect no that's
 

1789
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,680
to consider it to be a perfect no that's
a good question yeah that's a good

1790
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:32,690
a good question yeah that's a good
 

1791
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:36,970
a good question yeah that's a good
question I'm paid the price of assuming

1792
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:36,980
question I'm paid the price of assuming
 

1793
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,089
question I'm paid the price of assuming
that you don't know everything yeah I

1794
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:40,099
that you don't know everything yeah I
 

1795
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:41,589
that you don't know everything yeah I
don't know it's certainly much easier

1796
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:41,599
don't know it's certainly much easier
 

1797
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,960
don't know it's certainly much easier
games with perfect information are much

1798
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:43,970
games with perfect information are much
 

1799
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,520
games with perfect information are much
easier so if you can get away with it

1800
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:47,530
easier so if you can get away with it
 

1801
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,829
easier so if you can get away with it
you should but if the real situation is

1802
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:50,839
you should but if the real situation is
 

1803
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:52,900
you should but if the real situation is
of imperfect information then you're

1804
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:52,910
of imperfect information then you're
 

1805
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,980
of imperfect information then you're
going to have to deal with in for

1806
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:53,990
going to have to deal with in for
 

1807
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,230
going to have to deal with in for
imperfect information great so what

1808
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,240
imperfect information great so what
 

1809
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,539
imperfect information great so what
lessons have you learned the annual

1810
00:37:58,539 --> 00:37:58,549
lessons have you learned the annual
 

1811
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:01,589
lessons have you learned the annual
computer poker competition an incredible

1812
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:01,599
computer poker competition an incredible
 

1813
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,670
computer poker competition an incredible
accomplishment of AI you know you look

1814
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:03,680
accomplishment of AI you know you look
 

1815
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,060
accomplishment of AI you know you look
at the history of deep blue

1816
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,070
at the history of deep blue
 

1817
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:10,020
at the history of deep blue
go these kind of moments when I stepped

1818
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,030
go these kind of moments when I stepped
 

1819
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,330
go these kind of moments when I stepped
up in an engineering effort and a

1820
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:12,340
up in an engineering effort and a
 

1821
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,510
up in an engineering effort and a
scientific effort combined to beat the

1822
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:15,520
scientific effort combined to beat the
 

1823
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,190
scientific effort combined to beat the
best human players so what do you take

1824
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,200
best human players so what do you take
 

1825
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,620
best human players so what do you take
away from this whole experience what

1826
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:19,630
away from this whole experience what
 

1827
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,450
away from this whole experience what
have you learned about designing it has

1828
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:21,460
have you learned about designing it has
 

1829
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,430
have you learned about designing it has
systems that play these kinds of games

1830
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:23,440
systems that play these kinds of games
 

1831
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,270
systems that play these kinds of games
and what does that mean for sort of AI

1832
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:27,280
and what does that mean for sort of AI
 

1833
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,400
and what does that mean for sort of AI
in general for the future of IAI

1834
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:29,410
in general for the future of IAI
 

1835
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,830
in general for the future of IAI
development yeah so that's a good

1836
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:31,840
development yeah so that's a good
 

1837
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,900
development yeah so that's a good
question so there's so much to say about

1838
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:33,910
question so there's so much to say about
 

1839
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,870
question so there's so much to say about
it I do like this type of performance

1840
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:36,880
it I do like this type of performance
 

1841
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,870
it I do like this type of performance
oriented research although in my group

1842
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:39,880
oriented research although in my group
 

1843
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,120
oriented research although in my group
we go all the way from like idea to

1844
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,130
we go all the way from like idea to
 

1845
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,460
we go all the way from like idea to
theory to experiments to big system

1846
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:44,470
theory to experiments to big system
 

1847
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,260
theory to experiments to big system
fielding the commercialization so we

1848
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:46,270
fielding the commercialization so we
 

1849
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,780
fielding the commercialization so we
spend that spectrum but I think that in

1850
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:48,790
spend that spectrum but I think that in
 

1851
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,840
spend that spectrum but I think that in
a lot of situations in AI you really

1852
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:51,850
a lot of situations in AI you really
 

1853
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,520
a lot of situations in AI you really
have to build the big systems and

1854
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:53,530
have to build the big systems and
 

1855
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,160
have to build the big systems and
evaluate them at a scale before you know

1856
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,170
evaluate them at a scale before you know
 

1857
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,410
evaluate them at a scale before you know
what works and doesn't and we've seen

1858
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:58,420
what works and doesn't and we've seen
 

1859
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,570
what works and doesn't and we've seen
that in the computational game theory

1860
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:00,580
that in the computational game theory
 

1861
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,250
that in the computational game theory
community that there are a lot of

1862
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:02,260
community that there are a lot of
 

1863
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,340
community that there are a lot of
techniques that look good in the small

1864
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:04,350
techniques that look good in the small
 

1865
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,480
techniques that look good in the small
but then they cease to look good in the

1866
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:06,490
but then they cease to look good in the
 

1867
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,640
but then they cease to look good in the
large and we've also seen that there are

1868
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:08,650
large and we've also seen that there are
 

1869
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,850
large and we've also seen that there are
a lot of techniques that look superior

1870
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:11,860
a lot of techniques that look superior
 

1871
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,790
a lot of techniques that look superior
in theory and I really mean in terms of

1872
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:14,800
in theory and I really mean in terms of
 

1873
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,350
in theory and I really mean in terms of
convergence rates better like

1874
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:16,360
convergence rates better like
 

1875
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,880
convergence rates better like
first-order methods better convergence

1876
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:17,890
first-order methods better convergence
 

1877
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,920
first-order methods better convergence
rates like the CFR based based

1878
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:19,930
rates like the CFR based based
 

1879
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,200
rates like the CFR based based
algorithms yet the CFR pay based

1880
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,210
algorithms yet the CFR pay based
 

1881
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,020
algorithms yet the CFR pay based
algorithms are the fastest in practice

1882
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,030
algorithms are the fastest in practice
 

1883
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,190
algorithms are the fastest in practice
so it really tells me that you have to

1884
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:26,200
so it really tells me that you have to
 

1885
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,940
so it really tells me that you have to
test this in reality the theory isn't

1886
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:28,950
test this in reality the theory isn't
 

1887
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,460
test this in reality the theory isn't
tight enough if you will to tell you

1888
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:31,470
tight enough if you will to tell you
 

1889
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,540
tight enough if you will to tell you
which algorithms are better than the

1890
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:33,550
which algorithms are better than the
 

1891
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,200
which algorithms are better than the
others and you have to look at these

1892
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,210
others and you have to look at these
 

1893
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,240
others and you have to look at these
things that in the large because any

1894
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,250
things that in the large because any
 

1895
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,680
things that in the large because any
sort of projections you do from the

1896
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:40,690
sort of projections you do from the
 

1897
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,690
sort of projections you do from the
small and at least in this domain be

1898
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:42,700
small and at least in this domain be
 

1899
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,490
small and at least in this domain be
very misleading so that that's kind of

1900
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:44,500
very misleading so that that's kind of
 

1901
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,290
very misleading so that that's kind of
from from a kind of science and

1902
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:46,300
from from a kind of science and
 

1903
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,210
from from a kind of science and
engineering perspective from personal

1904
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:48,220
engineering perspective from personal
 

1905
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,010
engineering perspective from personal
perspective it's been just a wild

1906
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:50,020
perspective it's been just a wild
 

1907
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,070
perspective it's been just a wild
experience in that with the first poker

1908
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,080
experience in that with the first poker
 

1909
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,490
experience in that with the first poker
competition the first or first brains

1910
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:56,500
competition the first or first brains
 

1911
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,830
competition the first or first brains
versus AI man-machine poker competition

1912
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:58,840
versus AI man-machine poker competition
 

1913
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,510
versus AI man-machine poker competition
that we organized there had been by the

1914
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:00,520
that we organized there had been by the
 

1915
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,190
that we organized there had been by the
way for other poker games there had been

1916
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:02,200
way for other poker games there had been
 

1917
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,170
way for other poker games there had been
previous competitions but this was for

1918
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:04,180
previous competitions but this was for
 

1919
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,080
previous competitions but this was for
heads up No Limit this was the first and

1920
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,090
heads up No Limit this was the first and
 

1921
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:09,030
heads up No Limit this was the first and
I probably became the most hated person

1922
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,040
I probably became the most hated person
 

1923
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,700
I probably became the most hated person
in the world of Poker and I didn't mean

1924
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:11,710
in the world of Poker and I didn't mean
 

1925
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,970
in the world of Poker and I didn't mean
to III size that they cracked in the

1926
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:14,980
to III size that they cracked in the
 

1927
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,180
to III size that they cracked in the
game for yeah it was a lot of people

1928
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:18,190
game for yeah it was a lot of people
 

1929
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,530
game for yeah it was a lot of people
felt that it was a real

1930
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:19,540
felt that it was a real
 

1931
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,690
felt that it was a real
threat to the whole game the whole

1932
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:21,700
threat to the whole game the whole
 

1933
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,180
threat to the whole game the whole
existence of the game if AI becomes

1934
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:24,190
existence of the game if AI becomes
 

1935
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,700
existence of the game if AI becomes
better than humans people would be

1936
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:26,710
better than humans people would be
 

1937
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,100
better than humans people would be
scared to play poker because there are

1938
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,110
scared to play poker because there are
 

1939
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,480
scared to play poker because there are
the superhuman AI is running around

1940
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:30,490
the superhuman AI is running around
 

1941
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,370
the superhuman AI is running around
taking their money and you know all of

1942
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:32,380
taking their money and you know all of
 

1943
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,380
taking their money and you know all of
that so so I just it's just really

1944
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:34,390
that so so I just it's just really
 

1945
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,080
that so so I just it's just really
aggressive just in the comments were

1946
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,090
aggressive just in the comments were
 

1947
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,730
aggressive just in the comments were
super aggressive I got everything

1948
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:38,740
super aggressive I got everything
 

1949
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,330
super aggressive I got everything
it's just short of death threats do you

1950
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:42,340
it's just short of death threats do you
 

1951
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,740
it's just short of death threats do you
think the same was true for chess

1952
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:43,750
think the same was true for chess
 

1953
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,690
think the same was true for chess
because right now they just completed

1954
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:45,700
because right now they just completed
 

1955
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,430
because right now they just completed
the World Championships and chess and

1956
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,440
the World Championships and chess and
 

1957
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,560
the World Championships and chess and
humans just started ignoring the fact

1958
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:49,570
humans just started ignoring the fact
 

1959
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,900
humans just started ignoring the fact
that there's AI systems now that I'll

1960
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:51,910
that there's AI systems now that I'll
 

1961
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,850
that there's AI systems now that I'll
perform humans and they still enjoy the

1962
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:53,860
perform humans and they still enjoy the
 

1963
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,680
perform humans and they still enjoy the
game is still a beautiful game that's

1964
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:55,690
game is still a beautiful game that's
 

1965
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,450
game is still a beautiful game that's
what I think yeah and I think the same

1966
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:57,460
what I think yeah and I think the same
 

1967
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,910
what I think yeah and I think the same
thing happens in poker and so I didn't

1968
00:40:59,910 --> 00:40:59,920
thing happens in poker and so I didn't
 

1969
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,770
thing happens in poker and so I didn't
think of myself as somebody was gonna

1970
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:01,780
think of myself as somebody was gonna
 

1971
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,060
think of myself as somebody was gonna
kill the game and I don't think I did

1972
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,070
kill the game and I don't think I did
 

1973
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,310
kill the game and I don't think I did
yeah I've really learned to love this

1974
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:05,320
yeah I've really learned to love this
 

1975
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,170
yeah I've really learned to love this
game I wasn't a poker player before but

1976
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:07,180
game I wasn't a poker player before but
 

1977
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,330
game I wasn't a poker player before but
learn so many new ones is about it from

1978
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:09,340
learn so many new ones is about it from
 

1979
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,790
learn so many new ones is about it from
these AIS and they've really changed how

1980
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:11,800
these AIS and they've really changed how
 

1981
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,560
these AIS and they've really changed how
the game is played by the way so they

1982
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:13,570
the game is played by the way so they
 

1983
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,330
the game is played by the way so they
have these very Martian ways of playing

1984
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:15,340
have these very Martian ways of playing
 

1985
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,580
have these very Martian ways of playing
poker and the top humans are now

1986
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:17,590
poker and the top humans are now
 

1987
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,830
poker and the top humans are now
incorporating those types of strategies

1988
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:19,840
incorporating those types of strategies
 

1989
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,940
incorporating those types of strategies
into their own play so if anything to me

1990
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:22,950
into their own play so if anything to me
 

1991
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:27,300
into their own play so if anything to me
our work has made poker a richer more

1992
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:27,310
our work has made poker a richer more
 

1993
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,060
our work has made poker a richer more
interesting game for humans to play not

1994
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,070
interesting game for humans to play not
 

1995
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,160
interesting game for humans to play not
something that is gonna steer him as

1996
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,170
something that is gonna steer him as
 

1997
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,800
something that is gonna steer him as
away from it entirely just a quick

1998
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:34,810
away from it entirely just a quick
 

1999
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,680
away from it entirely just a quick
comment and something you said which is

2000
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:36,690
comment and something you said which is
 

2001
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:40,530
comment and something you said which is
if I may say so in academia is a little

2002
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:40,540
if I may say so in academia is a little
 

2003
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,220
if I may say so in academia is a little
bit rare sometimes it's pretty brave to

2004
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:44,230
bit rare sometimes it's pretty brave to
 

2005
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,810
bit rare sometimes it's pretty brave to
put your ideas to the test in the way

2006
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:45,820
put your ideas to the test in the way
 

2007
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,620
put your ideas to the test in the way
you described

2008
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:46,630
you described
 

2009
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,810
you described
saying that sometimes good ideas don't

2010
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:48,820
saying that sometimes good ideas don't
 

2011
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,480
saying that sometimes good ideas don't
work when you actually try to apply them

2012
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:51,490
work when you actually try to apply them
 

2013
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,700
work when you actually try to apply them
at scale and so where does that come

2014
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:53,710
at scale and so where does that come
 

2015
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,240
at scale and so where does that come
from I mean what if you could do a

2016
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:56,250
from I mean what if you could do a
 

2017
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:00,000
from I mean what if you could do a
advice for people what what drives you

2018
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,010
advice for people what what drives you
 

2019
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,250
advice for people what what drives you
in that sense were you always this way I

2020
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:02,260
in that sense were you always this way I
 

2021
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,500
in that sense were you always this way I
mean it takes a brave person I guess is

2022
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:04,510
mean it takes a brave person I guess is
 

2023
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,690
mean it takes a brave person I guess is
what I'm saying to test their ideas and

2024
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:06,700
what I'm saying to test their ideas and
 

2025
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,250
what I'm saying to test their ideas and
to see if this thing actually works

2026
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:08,260
to see if this thing actually works
 

2027
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,430
to see if this thing actually works
against human top human players and so

2028
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:11,440
against human top human players and so
 

2029
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,230
against human top human players and so
on yeah I don't know about brave but it

2030
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:13,240
on yeah I don't know about brave but it
 

2031
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,900
on yeah I don't know about brave but it
takes a lot of work it takes a lot of

2032
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:15,910
takes a lot of work it takes a lot of
 

2033
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,380
takes a lot of work it takes a lot of
work and a lot of time to organize do

2034
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:19,390
work and a lot of time to organize do
 

2035
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,180
work and a lot of time to organize do
make something big and to organize an

2036
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:21,190
make something big and to organize an
 

2037
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,160
make something big and to organize an
event and stuff like that and what

2038
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,170
event and stuff like that and what
 

2039
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,200
event and stuff like that and what
drives you in that effort because you

2040
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,210
drives you in that effort because you
 

2041
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,600
drives you in that effort because you
could still I would argue get a best

2042
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:27,610
could still I would argue get a best
 

2043
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,210
could still I would argue get a best
paper award and nips as you did in 17

2044
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:30,220
paper award and nips as you did in 17
 

2045
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,610
paper award and nips as you did in 17
without doing this that's right yes

2046
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:32,620
without doing this that's right yes
 

2047
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,870
without doing this that's right yes
and so so in general I believe it's very

2048
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:36,880
and so so in general I believe it's very
 

2049
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,630
and so so in general I believe it's very
important to do things in in the real

2050
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:39,640
important to do things in in the real
 

2051
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,330
important to do things in in the real
world and at scale and that's really

2052
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:42,340
world and at scale and that's really
 

2053
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,110
world and at scale and that's really
where the the the pudding if you will

2054
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:46,120
where the the the pudding if you will
 

2055
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,250
where the the the pudding if you will
proof is in the pudding that's what

2056
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:47,260
proof is in the pudding that's what
 

2057
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,110
proof is in the pudding that's what
that's where it is in this particular

2058
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:49,120
that's where it is in this particular
 

2059
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,850
that's where it is in this particular
case it was kind of a competition

2060
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:52,860
case it was kind of a competition
 

2061
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,920
case it was kind of a competition
between different groups and for many

2062
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:55,930
between different groups and for many
 

2063
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,860
between different groups and for many
years as to who can be the first one to

2064
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:58,870
years as to who can be the first one to
 

2065
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,690
years as to who can be the first one to
beat the top humans that heads up No

2066
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:00,700
beat the top humans that heads up No
 

2067
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,330
beat the top humans that heads up No
Limit Texas Hold'em so it became it

2068
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:03,340
Limit Texas Hold'em so it became it
 

2069
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:08,610
Limit Texas Hold'em so it became it
became kind of a like a competition who

2070
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:08,620
became kind of a like a competition who
 

2071
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,130
became kind of a like a competition who
can get there yeah so a little friendly

2072
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:11,140
can get there yeah so a little friendly
 

2073
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,050
can get there yeah so a little friendly
competition could be I can do wonders

2074
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:13,060
competition could be I can do wonders
 

2075
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:17,880
competition could be I can do wonders
for progress yes so the topic of

2076
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:17,890
for progress yes so the topic of
 

2077
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,440
for progress yes so the topic of
mechanism design which is really

2078
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:19,450
mechanism design which is really
 

2079
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,620
mechanism design which is really
interesting also kind of new to me

2080
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:21,630
interesting also kind of new to me
 

2081
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,820
interesting also kind of new to me
except as an observer if I don't know

2082
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:23,830
except as an observer if I don't know
 

2083
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,880
except as an observer if I don't know
politics and any I'm an observer of

2084
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:26,890
politics and any I'm an observer of
 

2085
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,130
politics and any I'm an observer of
mechanisms but you write in your paper

2086
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:29,140
mechanisms but you write in your paper
 

2087
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,010
mechanisms but you write in your paper
an automated mechanism design that I

2088
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:32,020
an automated mechanism design that I
 

2089
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,280
an automated mechanism design that I
quickly read so mechanism design is

2090
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:35,290
quickly read so mechanism design is
 

2091
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:38,130
quickly read so mechanism design is
designing the rules of the game so you

2092
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:38,140
designing the rules of the game so you
 

2093
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,320
designing the rules of the game so you
get a certain desirable outcome and you

2094
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,330
get a certain desirable outcome and you
 

2095
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,800
get a certain desirable outcome and you
have this work on doing so in an

2096
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:43,810
have this work on doing so in an
 

2097
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:45,390
have this work on doing so in an
automatic fashion as opposed to

2098
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:45,400
automatic fashion as opposed to
 

2099
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,550
automatic fashion as opposed to
fine-tuning it so what have you learned

2100
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:47,560
fine-tuning it so what have you learned
 

2101
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,600
fine-tuning it so what have you learned
from those efforts if you look say I

2102
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:51,610
from those efforts if you look say I
 

2103
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:54,840
from those efforts if you look say I
don't know at complex it's like our

2104
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:54,850
don't know at complex it's like our
 

2105
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,940
don't know at complex it's like our
political system can we design our

2106
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:56,950
political system can we design our
 

2107
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:00,150
political system can we design our
political system to have in an automated

2108
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,160
political system to have in an automated
 

2109
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,090
political system to have in an automated
fashion to have outcomes that we want

2110
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:03,100
fashion to have outcomes that we want
 

2111
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,750
fashion to have outcomes that we want
can we design something like traffic

2112
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:06,760
can we design something like traffic
 

2113
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,750
can we design something like traffic
lights to be smart where it gets

2114
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:09,760
lights to be smart where it gets
 

2115
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,450
lights to be smart where it gets
outcomes that we want so what are the

2116
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:12,460
outcomes that we want so what are the
 

2117
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,540
outcomes that we want so what are the
lessons you draw from that work yeah so

2118
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:15,550
lessons you draw from that work yeah so
 

2119
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,430
lessons you draw from that work yeah so
I still very much believe in the

2120
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:17,440
I still very much believe in the
 

2121
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,970
I still very much believe in the
automated mechanism design direction yes

2122
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:19,980
automated mechanism design direction yes
 

2123
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,560
automated mechanism design direction yes
but it's not a panacea

2124
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:22,570
but it's not a panacea
 

2125
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,440
but it's not a panacea
there are impossibility results in

2126
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:25,450
there are impossibility results in
 

2127
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,420
there are impossibility results in
mechanism design saying that there is no

2128
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:27,430
mechanism design saying that there is no
 

2129
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:31,410
mechanism design saying that there is no
mechanism that accomplishes objective X

2130
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:31,420
mechanism that accomplishes objective X
 

2131
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,730
mechanism that accomplishes objective X
in Class C so so they it's not gonna

2132
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:35,740
in Class C so so they it's not gonna
 

2133
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,370
in Class C so so they it's not gonna
there's no way using any mechanism

2134
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:38,380
there's no way using any mechanism
 

2135
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:41,070
there's no way using any mechanism
design tools manual or automated

2136
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:41,080
design tools manual or automated
 

2137
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,750
design tools manual or automated
to do certain things in mechanism design

2138
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:42,760
to do certain things in mechanism design
 

2139
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,910
to do certain things in mechanism design
he can't describe that again so meaning

2140
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:44,920
he can't describe that again so meaning
 

2141
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,070
he can't describe that again so meaning
there it's impossible to achieve that

2142
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:47,080
there it's impossible to achieve that
 

2143
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,930
there it's impossible to achieve that
yeah yes it was likely impossible so so

2144
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:51,940
yeah yes it was likely impossible so so
 

2145
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,550
yeah yes it was likely impossible so so
so these are these are not statements

2146
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:53,560
so these are these are not statements
 

2147
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,920
so these are these are not statements
about human ingenuity who might come up

2148
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:55,930
about human ingenuity who might come up
 

2149
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,690
about human ingenuity who might come up
with something smart these are proofs

2150
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:57,700
with something smart these are proofs
 

2151
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,270
with something smart these are proofs
that if you wanna accomplish properties

2152
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:00,280
that if you wanna accomplish properties
 

2153
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,360
that if you wanna accomplish properties
X in Class C that is not to oppose with

2154
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:03,370
X in Class C that is not to oppose with
 

2155
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,460
X in Class C that is not to oppose with
any mechanism the good thing about

2156
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:05,470
any mechanism the good thing about
 

2157
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,950
any mechanism the good thing about
automated mechanism design is that we're

2158
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:07,960
automated mechanism design is that we're
 

2159
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,980
automated mechanism design is that we're
not really designing for a class we're

2160
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:10,990
not really designing for a class we're
 

2161
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:13,140
not really designing for a class we're
designing for specific settings at the

2162
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:13,150
designing for specific settings at the
 

2163
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:16,200
designing for specific settings at the
time so even if there's an impossibility

2164
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:16,210
time so even if there's an impossibility
 

2165
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,300
time so even if there's an impossibility
result for the whole class it just

2166
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:18,310
result for the whole class it just
 

2167
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,390
result for the whole class it just
doesn't mean that all of the cases in

2168
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:21,400
doesn't mean that all of the cases in
 

2169
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,010
doesn't mean that all of the cases in
the class are impossible it just means

2170
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:23,020
the class are impossible it just means
 

2171
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,170
the class are impossible it just means
that some of the cases are impossible so

2172
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:25,180
that some of the cases are impossible so
 

2173
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,030
that some of the cases are impossible so
we can actually carve these islands of

00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,040
we can actually carve these islands of
 

2175
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,130
we can actually carve these islands of
possibility within these known

2176
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:29,140
possibility within these known
 

2177
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,260
possibility within these known
impossible classes and we've actually

2178
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,270
impossible classes and we've actually
 

2179
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,150
impossible classes and we've actually
done that so what one of the famous

2180
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:33,160
done that so what one of the famous
 

2181
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,490
done that so what one of the famous
results in mechanism design is a Meyer

2182
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:35,500
results in mechanism design is a Meyer

show that you can in many settings avoid
that and get the efficient trade anyway

2194
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
that and get the efficient trade anyway
 

2195
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,460
that and get the efficient trade anyway
depending on how they design the game

2196
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:53,470
depending on how they design the game
 

2197
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:55,230
depending on how they design the game
okay so depending how you design the

2198
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:55,240
okay so depending how you design the
 

2199
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,570
okay so depending how you design the
game and of course it's not it doesn't

2200
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:57,580
game and of course it's not it doesn't
 

2201
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,840
game and of course it's not it doesn't
in any way any way contradict to

impossibility result or impossibility
 

2205
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:05,640
impossibility result or impossibility
results is still there but it just finds

00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:05,650
results is still there but it just finds
 

2207
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,390
results is still there but it just finds
spots within this impossible class where

2208
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:09,400
spots within this impossible class where
 

2209
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,370
spots within this impossible class where
in those spots you don't have time

2210
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:11,380
in those spots you don't have time
 

2211
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,830
in those spots you don't have time
possibility sorry if I'm going a bit

00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,550
formal games our human interaction like
 

2225
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,060

a political system what how do you think

2226
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:36,070
a political system what how do you think
 

2227
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:41,000
a political system what how do you think
it's applicable to yeah politics or to

2228
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,010
it's applicable to yeah politics or to
 

2229

outcomes yeah yeah I do think so have

00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:51,430

2237
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,160

you seen success that successfully done

2239
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:56,110

yes and really oh you mean mechanism

2240
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:56,120
yes and really oh you mean mechanism
 

2241
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,670
yes and really oh you mean mechanism

mechanism design but so so mechanism

2244
00:46:59,680 --> 00:46:59,690
mechanism design but so so mechanism
 

2245
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:04,750
mechanism design but so so mechanism
design itself has had fairly limited

00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:04,760
design itself has had fairly limited
 

2247
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,300
design itself has had fairly limited
success so far there are certain cases

2248
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:07,310
success so far there are certain cases
 

2249
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:09,700
success so far there are certain cases
but most of the real-world situations

2250
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:09,710
but most of the real-world situations
 

2251
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:13,330
but most of the real-world situations
are actually not sound from a mechanism

2252
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:13,340
are actually not sound from a mechanism
 

2253
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,490
are actually not sound from a mechanism
design perspective even in those cases

2254
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:15,500
design perspective even in those cases
 

2255
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,650
design perspective even in those cases
where they've been designed by very

2256
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:17,660
where they've been designed by very
 

2257
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,510
where they've been designed by very
knowledgeable mechanism design people

2258
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:19,520
knowledgeable mechanism design people
 

2259
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,670
knowledgeable mechanism design people
the people are typically just taking

2260
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:21,680
the people are typically just taking
 

2261
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,560
the people are typically just taking
some insights from the theory and

2262
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:23,570
some insights from the theory and
 

2263
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,480
some insights from the theory and
applying those insights into the real

2264
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:25,490
applying those insights into the real
 

2265
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:27,790
applying those insights into the real
world rather than applying the

2266
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:27,800
world rather than applying the
 

2267
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,800
world rather than applying the
mechanisms directly so one famous

2268
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:29,810
mechanisms directly so one famous
 

2269
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:32,950
mechanisms directly so one famous
example of is the FCC spectrum auctions

2270
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:32,960
example of is the FCC spectrum auctions
 

2271
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,640
example of is the FCC spectrum auctions
so I've also had a small role in that

2272
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:36,650
so I've also had a small role in that
 

2273
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:40,450
so I've also had a small role in that
and very good economists have been where

2274
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:40,460
and very good economists have been where
 

2275
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,040
and very good economists have been where
excellent economists have been working

2276
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,050
excellent economists have been working
 

2277
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:44,440
excellent economists have been working
on that with no game theory yet the

2278
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:44,450
on that with no game theory yet the
 

2279
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,300
on that with no game theory yet the
rules that are designed in practice

2280
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:46,310
rules that are designed in practice
 

2281
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:49,270
rules that are designed in practice
they're they're such that bidding

00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:49,280
they're they're such that bidding
 

2283
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,940
they're they're such that bidding
truthfully is not the best strategy

truthfully is not the best strategy
 

2285
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:54,400
truthfully is not the best strategy
usually mechanism design we try to make

2286
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:54,410
usually mechanism design we try to make
 

2287
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,290
usually mechanism design we try to make
things easy for the participants so

2288
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:56,300
things easy for the participants so
 

2289
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,730
things easy for the participants so
telling the truth is the best strategy

2290
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:57,740
telling the truth is the best strategy
 

2291
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,940
telling the truth is the best strategy
but but even in those very high stakes

2292
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:00,950
but but even in those very high stakes
 

2293
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,560
but but even in those very high stakes
auctions where you have tens of billions

2294
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:02,570
auctions where you have tens of billions
 

2295
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:04,510
auctions where you have tens of billions
of dollars worth of expect from being

auctioned truth-telling is not the best
 

2299
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:10,570
auctioned truth-telling is not the best
strategy and by the way nobody knows

even a single optimal bidding strategy
 

2303
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,620
even a single optimal bidding strategy
for those auctions what's the challenge

2304
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:14,630
for those auctions what's the challenge
 

2305
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,210
for those auctions what's the challenge
of coming up with an optimum because

2306
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:16,220
of coming up with an optimum because
 

2307
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,510
of coming up with an optimum because
there's a lot of players and there's a

there's a lot of players and there's a

00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,180
now are there other things yes certainly
there are but there there is not one

2352
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:20,190
there are but there there is not one
 

2353
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,280

00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:38,180
diplomacy or Hanavi you know things like
that these are like recreational games

2366
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:38,190
that these are like recreational games
 

2367
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:41,840
that these are like recreational games
but none of them are really acknowledged

2368
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:41,850
but none of them are really acknowledged
 

2369
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,390
but none of them are really acknowledged
that's kind of the main next challenge

00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:38,750
practice what do you think would be
 

2415
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:44,510

00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:44,520
really you know a powerful result that
 

2417
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:49,130
really you know a powerful result that
would be surprising that would be if you

2418
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:49,140
would be surprising that would be if you
 

2419
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:52,490

can say I mean you know five years ten

2420
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:52,500
can say I mean you know five years ten
 

2421
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,060

years from now something that

2422
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:55,070
years from now something that
 

2423
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:57,140
years from now something that
statistically you would say is not very

2424
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:57,150
statistically you would say is not very
 

2425
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:00,430
statistically you would say is not very
likely but if there's a breakthrough

2426
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:00,440
likely but if there's a breakthrough
 

2427
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,620
likely but if there's a breakthrough
what achieve yeah so I think that

2428
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:02,630
what achieve yeah so I think that
 

2429
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:05,980
what achieve yeah so I think that
overall we're in a very different

2430
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:05,990
overall we're in a very different
 

2431
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:09,819
overall we're in a very different

let's say machine learning yes

2434
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:11,780
let's say machine learning yes
 

2435
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,240
let's say machine learning yes
so in machine learning it's a fairly

2436
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:13,250
so in machine learning it's a fairly
 

2437
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,460
so in machine learning it's a fairly
mature technology and it's very broadly

2438
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:15,470
mature technology and it's very broadly

you're you're asking about the
 

2463
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:43,950
you're you're asking about the
technology breakthrough but I think the

2464
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:43,960
technology breakthrough but I think the
 

2465
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,510
technology breakthrough but I think the
big big breakthrough is to be able to

2466
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:45,520
big big breakthrough is to be able to
 

2467
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,090
big big breakthrough is to be able to
show it hey maybe most of let's say

that's that's a good question I would
 

2507
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,820
that's that's a good question I would
say a little bit yes and no and what I

say a little bit yes and no and what I
 

2509
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,700
say a little bit yes and no and what I
mean by that is that these games are

2510
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:35,710
mean by that is that these games are
 

2511
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:37,710
mean by that is that these games are
ethic strategies let's say Nash

2512
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:37,720
ethic strategies let's say Nash

equilibrium it has provable properties

2514
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:40,390
equilibrium it has provable properties
 

2515
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,810
equilibrium it has provable properties
so it's unlike let's say deep learning

2516
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:42,820
so it's unlike let's say deep learning
 

2517
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,400
so it's unlike let's say deep learning
where you kind of cross your fingers

2518
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:44,410
where you kind of cross your fingers
 

2519
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,890
where you kind of cross your fingers
hopefully it'll work and then after the

2520
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:46,900
hopefully it'll work and then after the
 

2521
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,480
hopefully it'll work and then after the
fact when you have the weights you're

2522
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:48,490
fact when you have the weights you're
 

2523
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:49,710
fact when you have the weights you're
still crossing your fingers and I hope

2524
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:49,720
still crossing your fingers and I hope
 

2525
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:54,210
still crossing your fingers and I hope
it will work here you know that the

2526
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:54,220
it will work here you know that the
 

2527
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,520
it will work here you know that the
solution quality is there this provable

that's a whole other problem so that's

2536
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:05,080
that's a whole other problem so that's
 

2537
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,990
that's a whole other problem so that's
also I think it deep learning and

also I think it deep learning and

00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,090
also I think it deep learning and
computational game theory are in the

00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:52,659
in terms of optimality so looking into
 

2573
00:53:52,659 --> 00:53:56,549
in terms of optimality so looking into
the future there's a a few folks worried

the future there's a a few folks worried
 

2575
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,449
the future there's a a few folks worried
about the especially you look at the

about the especially you look at the
 

2577
00:54:00,459 --> 00:54:02,099
about the especially you look at the
game of poker which is probably one of

2578
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:02,109
game of poker which is probably one of
 

2579
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:04,049
game of poker which is probably one of
the last benchmarks in terms of games

the last benchmarks in terms of games
 

2581
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:07,019
the last benchmarks in terms of games
being solved they they worry about the

00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:07,029
being solved they they worry about the
 

2583
00:54:07,029 --> 00:54:09,539
being solved they they worry about the

future and the existential threats of
 

2585
00:54:09,549 --> 00:54:11,309

00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:19,289
that something that concerns you as much
are you more optimistic about the

are you more optimistic about the
 

2593
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:22,589
are you more optimistic about the
positive impacts of AI oh I am much more

optimistic about the positive impacts so
just in my own work what we've done so

2598
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:26,919
just in my own work what we've done so
 

2599
00:54:26,919 --> 00:54:28,979
just in my own work what we've done so
far we run the nationwide kidney

around alive today who would it be and
 

2605
00:54:33,789 --> 00:54:36,749
around alive today who would it be and
it's increased employment you had you

2606
00:54:36,749 --> 00:54:36,759
it's increased employment you had you
 

2607
00:54:36,759 --> 00:54:39,390
it's increased employment you had you
have a lot of people now running kidney

2608
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:39,400
have a lot of people now running kidney
 

2609
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,839
have a lot of people now running kidney
changes and at the transplant centers

00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:22,689
improvement in the world and this is
 

2643
00:55:22,689 --> 00:55:24,479
improvement in the world and this is
also like shifting value from somebody

2644
00:55:24,479 --> 00:55:24,489
also like shifting value from somebody
 

2645
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:26,789
also like shifting value from somebody
to somebody else just efficiency

2646

driving so there's less waste less

2650
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:31,329
driving so there's less waste less
 

2651
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:34,380
driving so there's less waste less
carbon footprint and so on it's a huge

2652
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:34,390
carbon footprint and so on it's a huge
 

2653
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:37,079
carbon footprint and so on it's a huge
positive impact in the near term but

2654
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:37,089
positive impact in the near term but
 

2655
00:55:37,089 --> 00:55:40,109
positive impact in the near term but
sort of to stay in it for a little

2656
00:55:40,109 --> 00:55:40,119
sort of to stay in it for a little
 

2657
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:42,269
sort of to stay in it for a little
longer because I think game theory is a

2658
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:42,279
longer because I think game theory is a
 

2659
00:55:42,279 --> 00:55:43,829
longer because I think game theory is a
role to play here well let me actually

2660
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:43,839
role to play here well let me actually
 

2661
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,329
role to play here well let me actually
come back and tell you this is one thing

2662
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:45,339
come back and tell you this is one thing
 

2663
00:55:45,339 --> 00:55:47,370
come back and tell you this is one thing
I think Asia is also going to make the

I think Asia is also going to make the
world much safer so so so that's another

2666
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:51,339
world much safer so so so that's another
 

2667
00:55:51,339 --> 00:55:54,179
world much safer so so so that's another
aspect that often gets overlooked well

2668
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:54,189
aspect that often gets overlooked well
 

2669
00:55:54,189 --> 00:55:55,589
aspect that often gets overlooked well
let me ask this question maybe you can

2670
00:55:55,589 --> 00:55:55,599
let me ask this question maybe you can
 

2671
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,899
let me ask this question maybe you can
speak to the the safer so I talked to

2672
00:55:57,899 --> 00:55:57,909
speak to the the safer so I talked to
 

2673
00:55:57,909 --> 00:56:00,689
speak to the the safer so I talked to
max tegmark is do a Russell who are very

2674
00:56:00,689 --> 00:56:00,699
max tegmark is do a Russell who are very
 

2675
00:56:00,699 --> 00:56:01,550
max tegmark is do a Russell who are very
concerned about

2676
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:01,560
concerned about
 

2677
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,980
concerned about
the resume yeah and often the concern is

2678
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:03,990
the resume yeah and often the concern is
 

2679
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:08,200
the resume yeah and often the concern is
about value misalignment so AI systems

2680
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:08,210
about value misalignment so AI systems
 

2681
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:12,980
about value misalignment so AI systems
basically working operating towards

2682
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:12,990
basically working operating towards
 

2683
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,950
basically working operating towards
goals that are not the same as human

2684
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:15,960
goals that are not the same as human
 

2685
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,800
goals that are not the same as human
civilization human beings so it seems

2686
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:18,810
civilization human beings so it seems
 

2687
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:20,540
civilization human beings so it seems
like game theory has a role to play

2688
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:20,550
like game theory has a role to play
 

2689
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:25,880
like game theory has a role to play
there to to make sure the values are

2690
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:25,890
there to to make sure the values are
 

2691
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:28,370
there to to make sure the values are
aligned with human beings I don't know

2692
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:28,380
aligned with human beings I don't know
 

2693
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,640
aligned with human beings I don't know
if that's how you think about it if not

2694
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:30,650
if that's how you think about it if not
 

2695
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:34,010
if that's how you think about it if not
how do you think AI might help with this

2696
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:34,020
how do you think AI might help with this
 

2697
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,220
how do you think AI might help with this
problem how do you think a i'ma make the

2698
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:37,230
problem how do you think a i'ma make the
 

2699
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:41,900
problem how do you think a i'ma make the
world safer yeah I think this value

2700
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:41,910
world safer yeah I think this value
 

2701
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:44,950
world safer yeah I think this value
misalignment is a fairly theoretical

2702
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:44,960
misalignment is a fairly theoretical
 

2703
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:50,090
misalignment is a fairly theoretical
worry and I haven't really seen it in it

2704
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:50,100
worry and I haven't really seen it in it
 

2705
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,200
worry and I haven't really seen it in it
because I do a lot of real applications

2706
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:51,210
because I do a lot of real applications
 

2707
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,870
because I do a lot of real applications
I don't see it anywhere

2708
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:53,880
I don't see it anywhere
 

2709
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,670
I don't see it anywhere
the closest I've seen it was the

2710
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:55,680
the closest I've seen it was the
 

2711
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,590
the closest I've seen it was the
following type of mental exercise really

2712
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:57,600
following type of mental exercise really
 

2713
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,350
following type of mental exercise really
where I had this argument in the late

2714
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:00,360
where I had this argument in the late
 

2715
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,820
where I had this argument in the late
80s when we were building these

2716
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:01,830
80s when we were building these
 

2717
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:03,800
80s when we were building these
transportation optimization systems and

2718
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:03,810
transportation optimization systems and
 

2719
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,300
transportation optimization systems and
somebody had heard that it's a good idea

2720
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:05,310
somebody had heard that it's a good idea
 

2721
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:08,450
somebody had heard that it's a good idea
to have high utilization of assets so

2722
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:08,460
to have high utilization of assets so
 

2723
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,860
to have high utilization of assets so
they told me that hey why don't you put

2724
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:09,870
they told me that hey why don't you put
 

2725
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,800
they told me that hey why don't you put
that as objective and we didn't even

2726
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:12,810
that as objective and we didn't even
 

2727
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:15,500
that as objective and we didn't even
pull it as an objective because I just

2728
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:15,510
pull it as an objective because I just
 

2729
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:17,390
pull it as an objective because I just
showed him it you know if you had that

2730
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:17,400
showed him it you know if you had that
 

2731
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,340
showed him it you know if you had that
as your objective the solution would be

2732
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:19,350
as your objective the solution would be
 

2733
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,350
as your objective the solution would be
to load your trucks full and driving

2734
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:21,360
to load your trucks full and driving
 

2735
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,120
to load your trucks full and driving
circles nothing would ever get delivered

2736
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:23,130
circles nothing would ever get delivered
 

2737
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,470
circles nothing would ever get delivered
you'd have a hundred percent utilization

2738
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:24,480
you'd have a hundred percent utilization
 

2739
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,470
you'd have a hundred percent utilization
so yeah I know this phenomenon I've

2740
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:27,480
so yeah I know this phenomenon I've
 

2741
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,230
so yeah I know this phenomenon I've
known this for over 30 years in but I've

2742
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,240
known this for over 30 years in but I've
 

2743
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,850
known this for over 30 years in but I've
never seen it actually be a problem

2744
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:31,860
never seen it actually be a problem
 

2745
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,520
never seen it actually be a problem
reality in reality and yes if you have

2746
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:34,530
reality in reality and yes if you have
 

2747
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:36,470
reality in reality and yes if you have
the wrong objective the AI will optimize

2748
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:36,480
the wrong objective the AI will optimize
 

2749
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,110
the wrong objective the AI will optimize
that to the hilt and it's gonna fit more

2750
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:39,120
that to the hilt and it's gonna fit more
 

2751
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,920
that to the hilt and it's gonna fit more
than some human who's kind of trying to

2752
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:41,930
than some human who's kind of trying to
 

2753
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:44,300
than some human who's kind of trying to
so within a half-baked way with some

2754
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:44,310
so within a half-baked way with some
 

2755
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:47,060
so within a half-baked way with some
human insight to but I just haven't seen

2756
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:47,070
human insight to but I just haven't seen
 

2757
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,460
human insight to but I just haven't seen
that materialize in practice there's

2758
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:49,470
that materialize in practice there's
 

2759
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,200
that materialize in practice there's
this gap that you actually put your

2760
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:51,210
this gap that you actually put your
 

2761
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:55,310
this gap that you actually put your
finger on very clearly just now between

2762
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:55,320
finger on very clearly just now between
 

2763
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,950
finger on very clearly just now between
theory and reality that's very difficult

2764
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:57,960
theory and reality that's very difficult
 

2765
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,770
theory and reality that's very difficult
to put into words I think it's what you

2766
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:00,780
to put into words I think it's what you
 

2767
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:03,890
to put into words I think it's what you
can theoretically imagine the worst

2768
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:03,900
can theoretically imagine the worst
 

2769
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,980
can theoretically imagine the worst
possible case or even yeah I mean bad

2770
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:06,990
possible case or even yeah I mean bad
 

2771
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,650
possible case or even yeah I mean bad
cases and what usually happens in

2772
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:09,660
cases and what usually happens in
 

2773
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,500
cases and what usually happens in
reality so for example to me maybe it's

2774
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:12,510
reality so for example to me maybe it's
 

2775
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:15,250
reality so for example to me maybe it's
something you can comment on

2776
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:15,260
something you can comment on
 

2777
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,900
something you can comment on
having grown up and I had grew up in the

2778
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:16,910
having grown up and I had grew up in the
 

2779
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,750
having grown up and I had grew up in the
Soviet Union you know there's currently

2780
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:19,760
Soviet Union you know there's currently
 

2781
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,870
Soviet Union you know there's currently
10,000 nuclear weapons in the world and

2782
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:21,880
10,000 nuclear weapons in the world and
 

2783
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,700
10,000 nuclear weapons in the world and
for many decades it's theoretically

2784
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:26,710
for many decades it's theoretically
 

2785
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:29,680
for many decades it's theoretically
surprising to me that the nuclear war is

2786
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:29,690
surprising to me that the nuclear war is
 

2787
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:33,010
surprising to me that the nuclear war is
not broken out do you think about this

2788
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:33,020
not broken out do you think about this
 

2789
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,900
not broken out do you think about this
aspect from a game theoretic perspective

2790
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:34,910
aspect from a game theoretic perspective
 

2791
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:39,700
aspect from a game theoretic perspective
in general why is that true why in

2792
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:39,710
in general why is that true why in
 

2793
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:41,800
in general why is that true why in
theory you could see how things would go

2794
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:41,810
theory you could see how things would go
 

2795
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,810
theory you could see how things would go
terribly wrong and somehow yet they have

2796
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:43,820
terribly wrong and somehow yet they have
 

2797
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,000
terribly wrong and somehow yet they have
not yeah how do you think so so I do

2798
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,010
not yeah how do you think so so I do
 

2799
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,830
not yeah how do you think so so I do
think that about that a lot I think the

2800
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:47,840
think that about that a lot I think the
 

2801
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,630
think that about that a lot I think the
biggest two threats that we're facing as

2802
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:49,640
biggest two threats that we're facing as
 

2803
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,120
biggest two threats that we're facing as
mankind one is climate change and the

2804
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,130
mankind one is climate change and the
 

2805
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:54,460
mankind one is climate change and the
other is nuclear war so I saw so those

2806
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:54,470
other is nuclear war so I saw so those
 

2807
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:56,770
other is nuclear war so I saw so those
are my main two worries that they're

2808
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:56,780
are my main two worries that they're
 

2809
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,600
are my main two worries that they're
worried about and I've tried to do

2810
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:58,610
worried about and I've tried to do
 

2811
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,400
worried about and I've tried to do
something about climate I thought about

2812
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:00,410
something about climate I thought about
 

2813
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,960
something about climate I thought about
trying to do something for climate

2814
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:01,970
trying to do something for climate
 

2815
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:04,720
trying to do something for climate
change twice actually before two of my

2816
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:04,730
change twice actually before two of my
 

2817
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:06,010
change twice actually before two of my
startups had actually commissioned

2818
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:06,020

studies of what we could do on those

2820
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:09,260
studies of what we could do on those
 

2821
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,780
studies of what we could do on those
things and we didn't really find a sweet

2822
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:10,790
things and we didn't really find a sweet
 

2823
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:12,400
things and we didn't really find a sweet
spot but I'm still keeping an eye out on

00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:12,410
spot but I'm still keeping an eye out on
 

2825

that if there's something where we could

2826
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:14,780
that if there's something where we could
 

2827
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,690
that if there's something where we could
actually provide a market solution or

2828
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:16,700
actually provide a market solution or
 

2829
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,450
actually provide a market solution or

markets was what we were looking at then
 

2839
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:28,840
markets was what we were looking at then
and it was much more the lack of

and it was much more the lack of
 

2841
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:31,180
and it was much more the lack of
political will by those markets were not

design so I could go in and make a

00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:35,840
design so I could go in and make a
 

2847
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,870
design so I could go in and make a
better market design but that wouldn't

2848
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:37,880
better market design but that wouldn't
 

2849
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,340
better market design but that wouldn't
really move the needle on the world very

2850
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:39,350
really move the needle on the world very
 

2851
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,500
really move the needle on the world very
much if there's no political will and in

the Chicago market was just shut down

2856
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:46,060
the Chicago market was just shut down
 

2857
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,520
the Chicago market was just shut down
and and so on so it and then it doesn't

00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:48,530
and and so on so it and then it doesn't
 

2859
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:50,350
and and so on so it and then it doesn't
really help create your market design

2860
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:50,360
really help create your market design

was there any nuclear side it's more so

2862
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:53,870

just been sitting there so how do you

2870
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:06,330
just been sitting there so how do you
 

2871
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:08,930
just been sitting there so how do you
think about what is the mechanism design

2872
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:08,940
think about what is the mechanism design
 

2873
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,870
think about what is the mechanism design
there that just made everything seem

2874
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:11,880
there that just made everything seem
 

2875
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,270
there that just made everything seem
stable and are you still extremely

2876
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:14,280
stable and are you still extremely
 

2877
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,910
stable and are you still extremely
worried I am still extremely worried so

2878
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:16,920
worried I am still extremely worried so
 

2879
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,310

you probably know the simple game theory

2880
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:19,320
you probably know the simple game theory
 

2881
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:22,849
you probably know the simple game theory
of mad so solar so this was a mutually

2882
01:00:22,849 --> 01:00:22,859
of mad so solar so this was a mutually
 

2883
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:24,589
of mad so solar so this was a mutually
assured destruction and it's like it

2884
01:00:24,589 --> 01:00:24,599
assured destruction and it's like it
 

2885
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:26,690
assured destruction and it's like it
doesn't require any computation with

2886
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:26,700
doesn't require any computation with
 

2887
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,280
doesn't require any computation with
small matrices you can actually convince

2888
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:28,290
small matrices you can actually convince
 

2889
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,660
small matrices you can actually convince
yourself that the game is such that

2890
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:29,670
yourself that the game is such that
 

2891
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,359
yourself that the game is such that
nobody wants to initiate yeah that's a

2892
01:00:32,359 --> 01:00:32,369
nobody wants to initiate yeah that's a
 

2893
01:00:32,369 --> 01:00:35,000
nobody wants to initiate yeah that's a
very coarse-grained analysis and it

2894
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,010
very coarse-grained analysis and it
 

2895
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:37,160
very coarse-grained analysis and it
really works in a situation where you

2896
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:37,170
really works in a situation where you
 

2897
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:39,829
really works in a situation where you
have two superpowers or small number of

2898
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:39,839
have two superpowers or small number of
 

2899
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,180
have two superpowers or small number of
superpowers now things are very

2900
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:41,190
superpowers now things are very
 

2901
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:43,550
superpowers now things are very
different you have a smaller nuke so the

2902
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:43,560
different you have a smaller nuke so the
 

2903
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,540
different you have a smaller nuke so the
threshold of initiating is smaller and

2904
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:47,550
threshold of initiating is smaller and
 

2905
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:50,270
threshold of initiating is smaller and
you have smaller countries and non non

2906
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:50,280
you have smaller countries and non non
 

2907
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,720
you have smaller countries and non non
nation actors who make it Nokes and so

2908
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:53,730
nation actors who make it Nokes and so
 

2909
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:55,730
nation actors who make it Nokes and so
on so it's I think it's riskier now than

2910
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:55,740
on so it's I think it's riskier now than
 

2911
01:00:55,740 --> 01:01:01,599
on so it's I think it's riskier now than
it was maybe ever before and what idea

2912
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:01,609
it was maybe ever before and what idea
 

2913
01:01:01,609 --> 01:01:04,370
it was maybe ever before and what idea
application by I you've talked about a

01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:04,380
application by I you've talked about a
 

2915
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,650
application by I you've talked about a
little bit but what is the most exciting

2916
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:06,660
little bit but what is the most exciting
 

2917
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,520
little bit but what is the most exciting
to you right now

2918

I mean you you're here at nips europe's

2920
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:10,050
I mean you you're here at nips europe's
 

2921
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:14,720
I mean you you're here at nips europe's
now you have a few excellent pieces of

2922
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:14,730
now you have a few excellent pieces of
 

2923
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:16,220
now you have a few excellent pieces of
work but what are you thinking into the

2924
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:16,230
work but what are you thinking into the
 

2925
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:17,810
work but what are you thinking into the
future with several companies you're

2926
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:17,820
future with several companies you're
 

2927
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,370
future with several companies you're
doing what's the most exciting thing or

2928
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:19,380
doing what's the most exciting thing or
 

2929
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,620
doing what's the most exciting thing or
one of the exciting things the number

2930
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:21,630
one of the exciting things the number
 

2931
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:24,260
one of the exciting things the number
one thing but for me right now is coming

2932
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:24,270
one thing but for me right now is coming
 

2933
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:26,750
one thing but for me right now is coming

game solving and applying them into the
 

2937
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,030

real world they're still very interested
 

2939
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,710
real world they're still very interested
in market design as well and we're doing

01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:33,720
in market design as well and we're doing
 

2941
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,810
in market design as well and we're doing
that in the optimized markets but I'm

that in the optimized markets but I'm
most interested if number one right now

be filled so it's so hard to just put
 

2957
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:52,849

needs to be done but when you're
 

2961
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:56,510
needs to be done but when you're
actually doing real applications the

2962
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:56,520
actually doing real applications the
 

2963
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,790
actually doing real applications the
applications tell you what needs to be

01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,740
the various players in industry or the
military or people who could really

2976
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:16,750
military or people who could really
 

2977
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:19,350
military or people who could really
benefit from it actually use it what's

2978
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:19,360
benefit from it actually use it what's
 

2979
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,570
benefit from it actually use it what's
that process like of you know in

2980
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:21,580
that process like of you know in
 

2981
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:22,710
that process like of you know in
autonomous vehicles will work with

2982
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:22,720
autonomous vehicles will work with
 

2983
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,040
autonomous vehicles will work with
automotive companies and they're in in

2984
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:26,050
automotive companies and they're in in
 

2985
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,300
automotive companies and they're in in
many ways they're a little bit

2986
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:27,310
many ways they're a little bit
 

2987
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,730
many ways they're a little bit
old-fashioned it's difficult they really

2988
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:29,740
old-fashioned it's difficult they really
 

2989
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,160
old-fashioned it's difficult they really
want to use this technology there's

2990
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:32,170
want to use this technology there's
 

2991
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:34,290
want to use this technology there's
clearly will have a significant benefit

2992
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:34,300
clearly will have a significant benefit
 

2993
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,710
clearly will have a significant benefit
but the systems aren't quite in place to

2994
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:37,720
but the systems aren't quite in place to
 

2995
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,800
but the systems aren't quite in place to
easily have them integrated in terms of

2996
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:40,810
easily have them integrated in terms of
 

2997
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:42,990
easily have them integrated in terms of
data in terms of compute in terms of all

2998
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:43,000
data in terms of compute in terms of all
 

2999
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,030
data in terms of compute in terms of all
these kinds of things so deuce is that

3000
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:45,040
these kinds of things so deuce is that
 

3001
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,640
these kinds of things so deuce is that
one of the bigger challenges that you're

3002
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:47,650
one of the bigger challenges that you're
 

3003
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:49,680
one of the bigger challenges that you're
facing and how do you tackle that

3004
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:49,690
facing and how do you tackle that
 

3005
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:51,270
facing and how do you tackle that
challenge yeah I think that's always a

3006
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:51,280
challenge yeah I think that's always a
 

3007
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,460
challenge yeah I think that's always a
challenge that that's gonna slowness and

3008
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:53,470
challenge that that's gonna slowness and
 

3009
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:56,430
challenge that that's gonna slowness and
inertia really of let's do things the

3010
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:56,440
inertia really of let's do things the
 

3011
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,380
inertia really of let's do things the
way we've always done it you just have

3012
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:58,390
way we've always done it you just have
 

3013
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:00,270
way we've always done it you just have
to find the internal champions that the

3014
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:00,280
to find the internal champions that the
 

3015
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,550
to find the internal champions that the
customer who understand that hey things

3016
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:02,560
customer who understand that hey things
 

3017
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,140
customer who understand that hey things
can't be the same way in the future

3018
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:04,150
can't be the same way in the future
 

3019
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:06,120
can't be the same way in the future
otherwise bad things are going to happen

3020
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:06,130
otherwise bad things are going to happen
 

3021
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:08,670
otherwise bad things are going to happen
and it's in order most vehicles it's

3022
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:08,680
and it's in order most vehicles it's
 

3023
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,110
and it's in order most vehicles it's
actually very interesting that the car

3024
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:10,120
actually very interesting that the car
 

3025
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,340
actually very interesting that the car
makers are doing that then they're very

3026
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:11,350
makers are doing that then they're very
 

3027
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:13,440
makers are doing that then they're very
traditional but at the same time you

3028
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:13,450
traditional but at the same time you
 

3029
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:14,910
traditional but at the same time you
have tech companies who have nothing to

3030
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:14,920
have tech companies who have nothing to
 

3031
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,310
have tech companies who have nothing to
do with cars or transportation like

3032
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:17,320
do with cars or transportation like
 

3033
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,250

Google and Baidu really pushing on

3034
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:20,260
Google and Baidu really pushing on
 

3035
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,700
Google and Baidu really pushing on
autonomous cars I find it fascinating

3036
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:22,710
autonomous cars I find it fascinating
 

3037
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:25,490
autonomous cars I find it fascinating
clearly you're super excited about

3038
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:25,500
clearly you're super excited about
 

3039
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,050
clearly you're super excited about
actually these ideas having an impact in

3040
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:28,060
actually these ideas having an impact in
 

3041
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,810
actually these ideas having an impact in
the world in terms of the technology in

3042
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:30,820
the world in terms of the technology in
 

3043
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:32,970
the world in terms of the technology in
terms of ideas and research their

3044
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:32,980
terms of ideas and research their
 

3045
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,760
terms of ideas and research their
directions that you're also excited

3046
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:35,770
directions that you're also excited
 

3047
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:39,840
directions that you're also excited
about whether that's on the some of the

3048
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:39,850
about whether that's on the some of the
 

3049
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:41,010
about whether that's on the some of the
approaches you talked about for the

3050
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:41,020
approaches you talked about for the
 

3051
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,110
approaches you talked about for the
imperfect information games whether it's

3052
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:43,120
imperfect information games whether it's
 

3053
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,370
imperfect information games whether it's
applying deep learning just some of

3054
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:44,380
applying deep learning just some of
 

3055
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,900
applying deep learning just some of
these problems is there something that

3056
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:45,910
these problems is there something that
 

3057
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:48,270
these problems is there something that
you're excited in in the research side

3058
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:48,280
you're excited in in the research side
 

3059
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,730
you're excited in in the research side
of things yeah yeah lots of different

3060
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:50,740
of things yeah yeah lots of different
 

3061
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,970
of things yeah yeah lots of different
things in the game solving so solving

3062
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:53,980
things in the game solving so solving
 

3063
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:57,890
things in the game solving so solving
even bigger games games will you have

3064
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:57,900
even bigger games games will you have
 

3065
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,300
even bigger games games will you have
more hidden action of the play your

3066
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:00,310
more hidden action of the play your
 

3067
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:02,970
more hidden action of the play your
actions as well poker is a game where

3068
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:02,980
actions as well poker is a game where
 

3069
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:06,000
actions as well poker is a game where
really the chance actions are hidden or

3070
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,010
really the chance actions are hidden or
 

3071
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,470
really the chance actions are hidden or
some of them are hidden but the player

3072
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:07,480
some of them are hidden but the player
 

3073
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,720
some of them are hidden but the player
actions are public

3074
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:10,730

 

3075
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:13,569

the multiplayer games of various sorts

3076
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:13,579
the multiplayer games of various sorts
 

3077
01:04:13,579 --> 01:04:18,759
the multiplayer games of various sorts
collusion opponent exploitation all and

3078
01:04:18,759 --> 01:04:18,769
collusion opponent exploitation all and
 

3079
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:21,970
collusion opponent exploitation all and
even longer games some games that

3080
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:21,980
even longer games some games that
 

3081
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,559
even longer games some games that
basically go forever but they're not

3082
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:23,569
basically go forever but they're not
 

3083
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:26,140
basically go forever but they're not
repeated so seek extensive phone games

3084
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:26,150
repeated so seek extensive phone games
 

3085
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:28,990
repeated so seek extensive phone games
that go forever whoa what what would

3086
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:29,000
that go forever whoa what what would
 

3087
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,519
that go forever whoa what what would
that even look like how do you represent

3088
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:30,529
that even look like how do you represent
 

3089
01:04:30,529 --> 01:04:32,289
that even look like how do you represent
that how do you solve that what's an

3090
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:32,299
that how do you solve that what's an
 

3091
01:04:32,299 --> 01:04:34,359
that how do you solve that what's an
example of a game like that or is this

3092
01:04:34,359 --> 01:04:34,369
example of a game like that or is this
 

3093
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:35,950
example of a game like that or is this
some of the stochastic games the imagine

3094
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:35,960
some of the stochastic games the imagine
 

3095
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,019
some of the stochastic games the imagine
let's say business strategy so it's and

3096
01:04:38,019 --> 01:04:38,029
let's say business strategy so it's and
 

3097
01:04:38,029 --> 01:04:39,910
let's say business strategy so it's and
not just modeling like a particular

3098
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:39,920
not just modeling like a particular
 

3099
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,160
not just modeling like a particular
interaction but thinking about the

3100
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:42,170
interaction but thinking about the
 

3101
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,539
interaction but thinking about the
business from here to eternity

3102
01:04:43,539 --> 01:04:43,549
business from here to eternity
 

3103
01:04:43,549 --> 01:04:48,609
business from here to eternity
or I think or let's let's say military

3104
01:04:48,609 --> 01:04:48,619
or I think or let's let's say military
 

3105
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:50,109
or I think or let's let's say military
strategy so it's not like war is going

3106
01:04:50,109 --> 01:04:50,119
strategy so it's not like war is going
 

3107
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:53,349
strategy so it's not like war is going
to go away how do you think about

3108
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:53,359
to go away how do you think about
 

3109
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,849
to go away how do you think about
military strategy that's going to go

3110
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:54,859
military strategy that's going to go
 

3111
01:04:54,859 --> 01:04:58,240
military strategy that's going to go
forever how do you even model that how

3112
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:58,250
forever how do you even model that how
 

3113
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:01,150
forever how do you even model that how
do you know whether a move was good that

3114
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:01,160
do you know whether a move was good that
 

3115
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:05,349
do you know whether a move was good that
you somebody made and and and so on so

3116
01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:05,359
you somebody made and and and so on so
 

3117
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,000
you somebody made and and and so on so
that that's kind of one direction I'm

3118
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:07,010
that that's kind of one direction I'm
 

3119
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:10,059
that that's kind of one direction I'm
also very interested in learning much

3120
01:05:10,059 --> 01:05:10,069
also very interested in learning much
 

3121
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:12,400
also very interested in learning much

that has theoretical generalization
 

3131
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,490
that has theoretical generalization
guarantees so if I see these many

3132
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:24,500
guarantees so if I see these many
 

3133
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,980
guarantees so if I see these many
training examples and I told my

3134
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:26,990
training examples and I told my
 

3135
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:29,440
training examples and I told my
algorithm in this way it's going to have

3136
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:29,450
algorithm in this way it's going to have
 

3137
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:30,999
algorithm in this way it's going to have
good performance on the real

3138
01:05:30,999 --> 01:05:31,009
good performance on the real
 

3139
01:05:31,009 --> 01:05:33,400
good performance on the real
distribution which have not seen so

3140
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:33,410
distribution which have not seen so
 

3141
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:35,019
distribution which have not seen so
which is kind of interesting that you

3142
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:35,029
which is kind of interesting that you
 

3143
01:05:35,029 --> 01:05:36,789
which is kind of interesting that you
know algorithm configuration has been

3144
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:36,799
know algorithm configuration has been
 

3145
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,970
know algorithm configuration has been
going on now for at least 17 years

3146
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:39,980
going on now for at least 17 years
 

3147
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:42,999
going on now for at least 17 years
seriously and there has not been any

3148
01:05:42,999 --> 01:05:43,009
seriously and there has not been any
 

3149
01:05:43,009 --> 01:05:46,329
seriously and there has not been any
generalization theory before well this

3150
01:05:46,329 --> 01:05:46,339
generalization theory before well this
 

3151
01:05:46,339 --> 01:05:48,640
generalization theory before well this
is really exciting and it's been it's a

3152
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:48,650
is really exciting and it's been it's a
 

3153
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:50,200
is really exciting and it's been it's a
huge honor to talk to you thank you so

3154
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:50,210
huge honor to talk to you thank you so
 

3155
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:51,849
huge honor to talk to you thank you so
much to us thank you for bringing

3156
01:05:51,849 --> 01:05:51,859
much to us thank you for bringing
 

3157
01:05:51,859 --> 01:05:53,380
much to us thank you for bringing
livadas to the world and all the great

3158
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:53,390
livadas to the world and all the great
 

3159
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:54,640
livadas to the world and all the great
work you're done well thank you very

3160
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:54,650
work you're done well thank you very
 

3161
01:05:54,650 --> 01:06:04,660
work you're done well thank you very
much it's been fun good questions

3162
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:04,670

 

3163
