somebody gives you information about
 

153
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,839
somebody gives you information about
another door so the correct answer is

you write a program that does the Monty

164
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:02,099
you write a program that does the Monty
 

165
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,059
you write a program that does the Monty
Hall you know game and then never

166
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:05,069
Hall you know game and then never
 

167
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,229
Hall you know game and then never
switches and always switches just

168
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
switches and always switches just
 

169
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,580
switches and always switches just
compare you would immediately see that

170
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:07,590
compare you would immediately see that
 

171
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,740
compare you would immediately see that
you don't have to be smart right you

172
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:09,750
you don't have to be smart right you
 

173
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,819
you don't have to be smart right you
know to figure out the answer

174
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:10,829
know to figure out the answer
 

175
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:12,470
know to figure out the answer
algorithmically you can just brute force

176
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
algorithmically you can just brute force
 

177
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,670
algorithmically you can just brute force
it out with data and say well I know the

178
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
it out with data and say well I know the
 

179
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,380
it out with data and say well I know the
answer is this because I ran the program

180
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:15,390
answer is this because I ran the program
 

181
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,970
answer is this because I ran the program
a billion times and these are the data

182
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:16,980
a billion times and these are the data
 

183
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,039
a billion times and these are the data
buckets that I got from it right so

184
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,049
buckets that I got from it right so
 

185
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,349
buckets that I got from it right so
empirically find it but what's the joy

186
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:21,359
empirically find it but what's the joy
 

187
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,240
empirically find it but what's the joy
of that what so for you for you

188
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,250
of that what so for you for you
 

189
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,479
of that what so for you for you
personally outside of family what

190
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:26,489
personally outside of family what
 

191
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,460
personally outside of family what
motivates you in this process

192
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:28,470
motivates you in this process
 

193
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,949
motivates you in this process
yes well to be honest I don't really

194
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
yes well to be honest I don't really
 

195
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,659
yes well to be honest I don't really
write a lot of code anymore like what I

196
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:32,669
write a lot of code anymore like what I
 

197
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:34,909
write a lot of code anymore like what I
do at discourse is like manager II stuff

198
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:34,919
do at discourse is like manager II stuff
 

199
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,520
do at discourse is like manager II stuff
which I always kind of despised right

200
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:37,530
which I always kind of despised right
 

201
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,809
which I always kind of despised right
like as a programmer you think of

202
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:38,819
like as a programmer you think of
 

203
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,129
like as a programmer you think of
managers as people who don't really do

204
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:40,139
managers as people who don't really do
 

205
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,979
managers as people who don't really do
anything themselves but the weird thing

206
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:42,989
anything themselves but the weird thing
 

207
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,629
anything themselves but the weird thing
about code is like you realize that like

208
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:44,639
about code is like you realize that like
 

209
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,580
about code is like you realize that like
language is code like the ability to

210
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:46,590
language is code like the ability to
 

211
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,129
language is code like the ability to
direct other people lets you get more

212
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:49,139
direct other people lets you get more
 

213
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:51,020
direct other people lets you get more
stuff than you've done then you could by

you can think of it as a systemic so

222
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:58,650
you can think of it as a systemic so
 

223
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,729
you can think of it as a systemic so
what what is it like to be what makes

what what is it like to be what makes
 

225
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,409
what what is it like to be what makes
before we get into program it what makes

226
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:03,419
before we get into program it what makes

a good manager what makes a good leader

228
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:04,940
a good manager what makes a good leader
 

229
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,430
a good manager what makes a good leader
well I think a leader it's all about

230
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:07,440
well I think a leader it's all about
 

231
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,979
well I think a leader it's all about
leading by example first of all like

232
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:08,989
leading by example first of all like
 

233
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:11,539
leading by example first of all like
sort of doing and being the things that

234
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:11,549
sort of doing and being the things that
 

235
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:13,159
sort of doing and being the things that
you want to be now this can be kind of

236
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,169
you want to be now this can be kind of

243
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,029

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:21,630
yourself like the hardest person to see
 

247
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,209
yourself like the hardest person to see
on the planet is really yourself right

248
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:23,219
on the planet is really yourself right
 

249
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:24,860
on the planet is really yourself right
it's funnier to see other people and and

250
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:24,870
it's funnier to see other people and and
 

251
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,390
it's funnier to see other people and and
and make judgments about them but

252
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
and make judgments about them but
 

253
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,480
and make judgments about them but
yourself like your

254
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,490
yourself like your
 

255
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,520

for biased you don't actually see

256
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:29,530
for biased you don't actually see
 

257
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,719
for biased you don't actually see
yourself the way other people see you

00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:30,729
yourself the way other people see you
 

259
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,370
yourself the way other people see you
often you're very very hard on yourself

260
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:32,380
often you're very very hard on yourself
 

261
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,839
often you're very very hard on yourself
in a way that other people really aren't

262
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:33,849
in a way that other people really aren't
 

263
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:36,540
in a way that other people really aren't
going to be so you know that's one of

264
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:36,550
going to be so you know that's one of
 

265
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,100
going to be so you know that's one of
the insights is you know you've got to

266
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,110
the insights is you know you've got to
 

267
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,689
the insights is you know you've got to
be really diligent about thinking like

268
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:39,699
be really diligent about thinking like
 

269
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,029
be really diligent about thinking like
am i behaving in a way that represents

270
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:42,039
am i behaving in a way that represents
 

271
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,670
am i behaving in a way that represents
how I want other people to behave right

272
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:44,680
how I want other people to behave right
 

273
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,320
how I want other people to behave right
like leading through example there's a

274
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,330
like leading through example there's a
 

275
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,300
like leading through example there's a
lot of examples of leaders that really

276
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,310
lot of examples of leaders that really
 

277
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,770
lot of examples of leaders that really
mess this up right like they make

278
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:49,780
mess this up right like they make
 

279
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,570
mess this up right like they make
decisions that are like wow that's why

280
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:51,580
decisions that are like wow that's why
 

281
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,370
decisions that are like wow that's why
would you know it's just it's it's it's

282
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:53,380
would you know it's just it's it's it's
 

283
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,080
would you know it's just it's it's it's
a bad example for other people so I

284
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,090
a bad example for other people so I
 

285
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,540
a bad example for other people so I
think leading by example is one the

286
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:57,550
think leading by example is one the
 

287
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,950
think leading by example is one the
other one I believe it is working really

288
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
other one I believe it is working really
 

289
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,629
other one I believe it is working really
hard now I don't mean like working

290
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
hard now I don't mean like working
 

291
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,370
hard now I don't mean like working
exhaustively but like showing a real

292
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:04,380
exhaustively but like showing a real
 

293
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,200
exhaustively but like showing a real
passion for the problem like you know

294
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,210
passion for the problem like you know
 

295
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,790
passion for the problem like you know
not necessarily your solution the

296
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
not necessarily your solution the
 

297
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,050
not necessarily your solution the
problem but the problem itself is just

298
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,060
problem but the problem itself is just
 

299
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,279
problem but the problem itself is just
one that you really believe in like with

300
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:11,289
one that you really believe in like with
 

301
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,529
one that you really believe in like with
discourse for example the problem that

302
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:13,539
discourse for example the problem that
 

303
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:14,610
discourse for example the problem that
we're looking at which is my current

304
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:14,620
we're looking at which is my current
 

305
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,820
we're looking at which is my current
project is how do you get people in

00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,999
right like that's not the purpose of
this kind of communication so I would

344
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:48,009
this kind of communication so I would
 

345
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,820
this kind of communication so I would
say you know leadership is about you

353
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,209
to be and making sure that you're
actually doing those things and there's

354
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:57,219
actually doing those things and there's
 

355
00:05:57,219 --> 00:05:58,860
actually doing those things and there's
a trick to that too because the things

356
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:58,870
a trick to that too because the things
 

357
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,809
a trick to that too because the things
you don't do also say a lot about what

358
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:00,819
you don't do also say a lot about what
 

359
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,959

361
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:05,309
you are yeah so let's pause on that one
so those two things are fascinating so

362
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:05,319
so those two things are fascinating so
 

363
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,320
so those two things are fascinating so

how do you have as a leader as that
 

365
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,760
how do you have as a leader as that
self-awareness so you just said it's

366
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:08,770
self-awareness so you just said it's
 

367
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,649
self-awareness so you just said it's
really hard to be self-aware so for you

368
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:10,659
really hard to be self-aware so for you
 

369
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:12,809
really hard to be self-aware so for you
personally or maybe for other leaders

how do you how do you get that service

382
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:24,699
how do you how do you get that service
 

383
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,850
how do you how do you get that service
there's two aspects that one is like

384
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:26,860
there's two aspects that one is like
 

385
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,140
there's two aspects that one is like
processing feedback that you're getting

386
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,150
processing feedback that you're getting
 

387
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,170
processing feedback that you're getting
so how you get feedback well right sorry

388
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:31,180
so how you get feedback well right sorry
 

389
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,399
so how you get feedback well right sorry
are you getting feedback right like so

390
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:32,409
are you getting feedback right like so
 

391
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,629
are you getting feedback right like so
one way we do it for example a discourse

392
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:33,639
one way we do it for example a discourse
 

393
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,519
one way we do it for example a discourse
we have three co-founders and we

394
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:35,529
we have three co-founders and we
 

395
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,469
we have three co-founders and we
periodically talk about decisions before

396
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:37,479
periodically talk about decisions before
 

397
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,839
periodically talk about decisions before
we make them so it's not like one person

398
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:39,849
we make them so it's not like one person
 

399
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,260
we make them so it's not like one person
can make a mistake or like

400
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,270
can make a mistake or like
 

401
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,280
can make a mistake or like
that's you know there can be

402
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,290
that's you know there can be
 

403
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,300
that's you know there can be
misunderstanding things like this so

404
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,310
misunderstanding things like this so
 

405
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,980
misunderstanding things like this so
it's part of like group consensus of

406
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:44,990
it's part of like group consensus of
 

407
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,750
it's part of like group consensus of
leadership is like it's good to have I

408
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:46,760
leadership is like it's good to have I
 

409
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,410
leadership is like it's good to have I
think

410
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:47,420
think
 

411
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,360
think
systems where there's one leader and

412
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,370
systems where there's one leader and
 

413
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,800
systems where there's one leader and
that leader has the rule of absolute law

414
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:50,810
that leader has the rule of absolute law
 

415
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,810
that leader has the rule of absolute law
are just really dangerous and my

416
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:52,820
are just really dangerous and my
 

417
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,310
are just really dangerous and my
experience for communities for example

418
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:54,320
experience for communities for example
 

419
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,780
experience for communities for example
like a few of communities run by one

420
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:55,790
like a few of communities run by one
 

421
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,950
like a few of communities run by one
person that one person makes all the

422
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
person that one person makes all the
 

423
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,390
person that one person makes all the
decisions that person's gonna have a bad

424
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
decisions that person's gonna have a bad
 

425
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,250
decisions that person's gonna have a bad
day something could happen to that

426
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:00,260
day something could happen to that
 

427
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,110
day something could happen to that
person you know something you know

428
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,120
person you know something you know
 

429
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,700
person you know something you know
there's a lot of variables so like at

430
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:03,710
there's a lot of variables so like at
 

431
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,930
there's a lot of variables so like at
first when you think about leadership

432
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:04,940
first when you think about leadership
 

433
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,550
first when you think about leadership
haven't have multiple people doing

434
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
haven't have multiple people doing
 

435
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,230
haven't have multiple people doing
leadership and have them talk amongst

436
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
leadership and have them talk amongst
 

437
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,580
leadership and have them talk amongst
each other so giving each other feedback

438
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:09,590
each other so giving each other feedback
 

439
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,770
each other so giving each other feedback
about the decisions that they're making

440
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:11,780
about the decisions that they're making
 

441
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,720
about the decisions that they're making
and then when you do get feedback I

442
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:13,730
and then when you do get feedback I
 

443
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,860
and then when you do get feedback I
think there's that little voice in your

444
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:14,870
think there's that little voice in your
 

445
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,140
think there's that little voice in your
head right like or your gut or wherever

446
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,150
head right like or your gut or wherever
 

447
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,450
head right like or your gut or wherever
you want to put it in your putti I think

448
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:19,460
you want to put it in your putti I think
 

449
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,570
you want to put it in your putti I think
that voice is really important like I

450
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:22,580
that voice is really important like I
 

451
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,490
that voice is really important like I
think most people who have any kind of

452
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:24,500
think most people who have any kind of
 

453
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,170
think most people who have any kind of
moral compass or like want to do most

454
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:26,180
moral compass or like want to do most
 

455
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,460
moral compass or like want to do most

459
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,120
believe that I mean there might be a
handful of sociopaths out there that

460
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,130
handful of sociopaths out there that

learning so we had to backfill all these
 

931
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,060
learning so we had to backfill all these
rules as we sort of figured out what the

heck it was we were doing and the system
 

935
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,720
heck it was we were doing and the system
came very strict over time and a lot of

came very strict over time and a lot of
 

937
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,980
came very strict over time and a lot of

now again there's always more than one
way to do it there's complete

1060
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:40,300
way to do it there's complete
 

1061
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,210
way to do it there's complete
flexibility and system around that but

1062
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:42,220
flexibility and system around that but
 

1063
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,340
flexibility and system around that but
where it falls down is stuff like poker

00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,030
sample questions and and if he gets
 

1075
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,190
sample questions and and if he gets
enough support within the network we

1076
00:16:59,190 --> 00:16:59,200
enough support within the network we
 

1077
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,690
enough support within the network we
launch that Q&A site so someone's we

1078
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:00,700
launch that Q&A site so someone's we
 

1079
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,520
launch that Q&A site so someone's we
launched where poker and Lego and they

1080
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:02,530
launched where poker and Lego and they
 

1081
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,949
launched where poker and Lego and they
did horribly right because I mean there

1082
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
did horribly right because I mean there
 

1083
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,360
did horribly right because I mean there
might still be there lingering on in

1084
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:06,370
might still be there lingering on in
 

1085
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,980
might still be there lingering on in
some form but it was an experiment this

1086
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:07,990
some form but it was an experiment this
 

1087
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,960
some form but it was an experiment this
is like a test right and some subjects

1088
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:09,970
is like a test right and some subjects
 

1089
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,640
is like a test right and some subjects
work super well in the stack engine and

1090
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:11,650
work super well in the stack engine and
 

1091
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,630
work super well in the stack engine and
some don't

1092
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
some don't
 

1093
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,550
some don't
but the reason Lego and Poker don't work

1094
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:14,560
but the reason Lego and Poker don't work
 

1095
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,140
but the reason Lego and Poker don't work
is because they're so social really it's

1096
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,150
is because they're so social really it's
 

1097
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,600
is because they're so social really it's

slightly better phrasing because you
 

1941
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,840
slightly better phrasing because you
have two more time to think about your

probably the single best writing advice
 

1949

don't know right so those are the the
 

2401
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,110
don't know right so those are the the
crucial seeds but then starting to build

2402
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:27,120
crucial seeds but then starting to build
 

2403
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,250
crucial seeds but then starting to build
stuff whether it's you programmer

2404
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:28,260
stuff whether it's you programmer
 

2405
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,020

there's video types so there's tons of
 

2407
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,340
there's video types so there's tons of
research there's tons of research like

2408
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:31,350
research there's tons of research like
 

2409
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,540
research there's tons of research like
what what's out there that failed

2410
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:32,550
what what's out there that failed
 

2411
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,650
what what's out there that failed
because a lot of people looked at

2412
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:33,660
because a lot of people looked at
 

2413
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,750
because a lot of people looked at
successes I look at how successful X's

2414
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:35,760
successes I look at how successful X's
 

2415

everybody looks at the successes those
 

2417
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,560
everybody looks at the successes those
are boring show me the failures because

2418
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:39,570
are boring show me the failures because
 

2419
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,150
are boring show me the failures because
that is what's interesting that's where

2420
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,160
that is what's interesting that's where
 

2421
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,320
that is what's interesting that's where
people were experimenting that's where

2422
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,330
people were experimenting that's where
 

2423
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,809
people were experimenting that's where
people were pushing but

2424
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:43,819
people were pushing but
 

2425
00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:45,819

and they failed but they probably failed

2426
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:45,829
and they failed but they probably failed
 

2427
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:47,679
and they failed but they probably failed

00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:47,689
for reasons that weren't directly about
 

2429
00:37:47,689 --> 00:37:50,169
for reasons that weren't directly about
the quality of their idea right yeah so

2430
00:37:50,169 --> 00:37:50,179
the quality of their idea right yeah so
 

2431
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:51,849
the quality of their idea right yeah so
look at all the failures don't just look

2432
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:51,859
look at all the failures don't just look
 

2433
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:53,079
look at all the failures don't just look
what everybody looks at which is a go

2434
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:53,089

2439
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:58,089
look at the failures look at the things
that didn't work research the entire

2440
00:37:58,089 --> 00:37:58,099
that didn't work research the entire
 

2441
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:00,909
that didn't work research the entire
field and so that's the research that I

2442

field and so that's the research that I
 

2443
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:02,620
field and so that's the research that I
was doing that led me to Robin Wright

2495
00:38:47,509 --> 00:38:49,179
it's because there's so much tension
that we built into the system around

2496
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:49,189
that we built into the system around
 

2497
00:38:49,189 --> 00:38:51,309
that we built into the system around
like trying to get good good results out

like trying to get good good results out
 

2499
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:55,179
like trying to get good good results out
of the system and you know it it's not a

2500
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:55,189
of the system and you know it it's not a
 

2501
00:38:55,189 --> 00:38:56,979
of the system and you know it it's not a
free that stuff doesn't come for free

2502
00:38:56,979 --> 00:38:56,989
free that stuff doesn't come for free
 

2503
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:58,689
free that stuff doesn't come for free
right it's not like we we're all have

00:38:58,689 --> 00:38:58,699
right it's not like we we're all have
 

2505
00:38:58,699 --> 00:39:00,819
right it's not like we we're all have
perfect answers and nobody will have to

2506
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:00,829
perfect answers and nobody will have to
 

2507
00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:03,069
perfect answers and nobody will have to
get their feelings hurt or nobody will

2508
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:03,079
get their feelings hurt or nobody will
 

2509
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,629
get their feelings hurt or nobody will
have to get down voted like that it

2510
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:04,639

2512
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:06,889
doesn't work that way right like so this
 

2513
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,889
doesn't work that way right like so this
is an interesting point a small tangent

2514
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:08,899
is an interesting point a small tangent
 

2515
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:12,399
is an interesting point a small tangent

2529
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:28,209
goal of Stack Overflow isn't about is to
write a question not that's not about

2530
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:28,219
write a question not that's not about
 

2531
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:31,959
write a question not that's not about
you it's about the question that will

but that's a tough sell right because

2536
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:37,699
but that's a tough sell right because
 

2537
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:39,370
but that's a tough sell right because
people are like well you know I don't

look I'm a little nervous cuz I know I
gotta do my best work right the other

2786
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:26,599
gotta do my best work right the other
 

2787
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:28,120
gotta do my best work right the other
one is something you talk about which is

also really interesting to me is
 

2791
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:34,000
also really interesting to me is
duplicate questions or do it's a it's a

duplicate questions or do it's a it's a
 

2793
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,420
duplicate questions or do it's a it's a
really difficult problem that you

2794
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:37,430
really difficult problem that you
 

2795
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,309
really difficult problem that you
highlight super far is super hard like

2796
00:43:39,309 --> 00:43:39,319
highlight super far is super hard like
 

2797
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:42,160
highlight super far is super hard like
you could take one little topic and you

2798
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,170
you could take one little topic and you
 

2799
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:45,010
you could take one little topic and you
could probably write 10 20 30 ways of

could probably write 10 20 30 ways of
 

2801
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,200
could probably write 10 20 30 ways of
asking about that topic and there will

2802
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:47,210
asking about that topic and there will
 

2803
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,700
asking about that topic and there will
be all different I don't know if there

2804
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:48,710
be all different I don't know if there
 

2805
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,250
be all different I don't know if there
should be one page that answers all of

should be one page that answers all of
 

2807
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,960
should be one page that answers all of
it is there a way that Stack Overflow

2808
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:54,970
it is there a way that Stack Overflow
 

2809
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:59,500
it is there a way that Stack Overflow
can help disambiguate like separate

also devalues the reputation system

2870
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:54,110
also devalues the reputation system
 

2871
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,780
also devalues the reputation system
which programmers hate as I previously

2872

somebody are sorry gave that answer so
 

2881
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,790
somebody are sorry gave that answer so
why are you getting reputation for the

2882
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:03,800
why are you getting reputation for the
 

2883
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,470
why are you getting reputation for the
same answer as the other guy who gave it

4 years ago people get offended by that
 

2887
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,070
4 years ago people get offended by that
right so the reputation system itself

2888
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:09,080
right so the reputation system itself
 

2889
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,610
right so the reputation system itself
adds tension to the system in that the

2890
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:12,620
adds tension to the system in that the
 

2891
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,690
adds tension to the system in that the
people who have a lot of reputation

2892
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:13,700
people who have a lot of reputation
 

2893
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,880
people who have a lot of reputation
become very incentivized to enforce the

2894
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:15,890
become very incentivized to enforce the
 

2895
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:18,340
become very incentivized to enforce the
reputation system and for the most part

2896
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,350
reputation system and for the most part
 

2897
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:19,960
reputation system and for the most part
that's good I know it sounds weird but

2898
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:19,970
that's good I know it sounds weird but
 

2899
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,880
that's good I know it sounds weird but
for most parts like look strict systems

2900
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:21,890
for most parts like look strict systems
 

2901
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:24,130
for most parts like look strict systems
I think to use Tec powerful you have to

2902
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:24,140
I think to use Tec powerful you have to
 

2903
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,480
I think to use Tec powerful you have to
have the idea that ok strict systems

2904
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:25,490
have the idea that ok strict systems
 

2905
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,220
have the idea that ok strict systems
ultimately work better and I do think in

2906
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:27,230
ultimately work better and I do think in
 

2907
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,620
ultimately work better and I do think in

programming you're familiar with loose
typing versus strict typing right the

2910
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:31,370
typing versus strict typing right the
 

2911
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,160
typing versus strict typing right the
idea that you can declare a variable not

2912
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:33,170
idea that you can declare a variable not
 

2913
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,270
idea that you can declare a variable not
declare a variable rather you start

2914
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:34,280
declare a variable rather you start
 

2915
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,440
declare a variable rather you start
using a variable and ok I see it's

2916
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:35,450
using a variable and ok I see it's
 

2917
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,000
using a variable and ok I see it's
implicitly an integer BAM awesome

2918
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,010
implicitly an integer BAM awesome

awesome simpler right why would I want

2924
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:42,800
awesome simpler right why would I want
 

2925
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,320
awesome simpler right why would I want
to worry about typing and for a long

2926
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:44,330
to worry about typing and for a long
 

2927
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:45,880
to worry about typing and for a long
time like in the Ruby community they're

2928
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:45,890
time like in the Ruby community they're
 

2929
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,110
time like in the Ruby community they're
like yeah this is awesome like you just

2930
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:47,120
like yeah this is awesome like you just
 

2931
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,370
like yeah this is awesome like you just
do a bunch of unit testing which is

2932
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:48,380
do a bunch of unit testing which is
 

2933
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,290
do a bunch of unit testing which is
testing your programs validity after the

2934
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:50,300
testing your programs validity after the
 

2935
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,320
testing your programs validity after the
fact to catch any bugs that that strict

2936
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:53,330
fact to catch any bugs that that strict
 

2937
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,490
fact to catch any bugs that that strict
typing of variables would have caught

2938
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:54,500
typing of variables would have caught
 

2939
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,020
typing of variables would have caught
and now you have this thing called

2940
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,030

development right like in terms of
 

2949
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,170
development right like in terms of
language design and says no no no we

2950
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:05,180
language design and says no no no we
 

2951
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,790
language design and says no no no we
want to bolt on a strict type system to

00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:13,970
50 latent bugs that we didn't know about
 

2961
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,240
50 latent bugs that we didn't know about
right like this is super common so I

2962
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:16,250
right like this is super common so I
 

2963
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:19,510
right like this is super common so I
think there is a truth in programming

2964
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:19,520
think there is a truth in programming
 

2965
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,360
think there is a truth in programming
that strictness it's not the goal we're

2966
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:22,370
that strictness it's not the goal we're
 

2967
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,590
that strictness it's not the goal we're
not saying be super strict cuz

2968
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:23,600
not saying be super strict cuz
 

2969
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,290
not saying be super strict cuz
strictness is correct no it's no no

2970
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:26,300
strictness is correct no it's no no
 

2971
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,760
strictness is correct no it's no no
strictness produces better results

2972
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:27,770
strictness produces better results
 

2973
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,550
strictness produces better results
that's what I'm saying right so strict

2974
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:30,560
that's what I'm saying right so strict
 

2975
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,140
that's what I'm saying right so strict
typing of variables I would say you

2976
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:32,150
typing of variables I would say you
 

2977
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,970
typing of variables I would say you
almost universally have consensus now is

2978
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:33,980
almost universally have consensus now is
 

2979
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,190
almost universally have consensus now is
basically correct should be that way in

2980
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:36,200
basically correct should be that way in
 

2981
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,320
basically correct should be that way in
every language right duck equals 5

2982
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:38,330

2983
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:38,640
every language right duck equals 5
should

2984
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:38,650
should
 

2985
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:39,900
should
during an error because you know you

2986
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:39,910
during an error because you know you
 

2987
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,730
during an error because you know you
didn't clear you didn't tell me the duck

2988
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:41,740
didn't clear you didn't tell me the duck
 

2989
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,650
didn't clear you didn't tell me the duck
was an integer right that's a bug right

2990
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:43,660
was an integer right that's a bug right
 

2991
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,090
was an integer right that's a bug right
or maybe you missed time you typed deck

2992
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:45,100
or maybe you missed time you typed deck
 

2993
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,740
or maybe you missed time you typed deck
right instead of duck right you never

2994
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:46,750
right instead of duck right you never
 

2995
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,540
right instead of duck right you never
know this happens all the time right so

2996
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:48,550
know this happens all the time right so
 

2997
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:51,180
know this happens all the time right so
with that in mind I will say that the

2998
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:51,190
with that in mind I will say that the
 

2999
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,770
with that in mind I will say that the
strictness the system is correct now

3000
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:52,780
strictness the system is correct now
 

3001
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,880
strictness the system is correct now
that doesn't mean cruel

3002
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:53,890
that doesn't mean cruel

angry it just means tricked okay so I

3006
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:57,970
angry it just means tricked okay so I
 

3007
00:46:57,970 --> 00:46:59,340
angry it just means tricked okay so I
think where there's misunderstanding is

3008
00:46:59,340 --> 00:46:59,350
think where there's misunderstanding is
 

3009
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,350
think where there's misunderstanding is
and people get cranky right like another

3010
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:01,360
and people get cranky right like another
 

3011
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,490
and people get cranky right like another
question you asked is like why are

3012
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:02,500
question you asked is like why are
 

3013
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,310
question you asked is like why are
programmers kind of mean sometimes well

3014
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:05,320
programmers kind of mean sometimes well
 

3015
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,110

who'da programmers work with all day

3016
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:07,120
who'da programmers work with all day

who'da programmers work with all day
long so I have a theory that if you're

3018
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:08,830
long so I have a theory that if you're
 

3019
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,370
long so I have a theory that if you're
at a job and you work with assholes all

3020
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:11,380
at a job and you work with assholes all

what do you eventually become an asshole

3024
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:14,740
what do you eventually become an asshole
 

3025
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,950
what do you eventually become an asshole
an asshole and what is the computer

3026
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:16,960
an asshole and what is the computer
 

3027
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,350
an asshole and what is the computer
except the world's biggest asshole

3028
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:18,360
except the world's biggest asshole
 

3029
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,300
except the world's biggest asshole
because the computer has no time for

00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:21,310
because the computer has no time for

crashing down right one semicolon has
 

3037
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,440
crashing down right one semicolon has
crashed space missions right so that's

3038
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:28,450
crashed space missions right so that's
 

3039
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:29,010
crashed space missions right so that's
normal

normal

so you begin to internalize that you

3042
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:30,700
so you begin to internalize that you
 

3043
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,750
so you begin to internalize that you
begin to think oh my coworker the

3044
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:33,760
begin to think oh my coworker the
 

3045
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,060
begin to think oh my coworker the
computer is super strict and kind of a

3046
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:36,070
computer is super strict and kind of a
 

3047
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:38,670
computer is super strict and kind of a
jerk about everything so that's kind of

3048
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:38,680
jerk about everything so that's kind of
 

3049
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,130
jerk about everything so that's kind of
how I'm gonna be because I work with

3050
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:41,140
how I'm gonna be because I work with
 

3051
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,810
how I'm gonna be because I work with
this computer and I have to accede to

3052
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:42,820
this computer and I have to accede to
 

3053
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,330
this computer and I have to accede to
its terms on everything so therefore you

3054
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:45,340
its terms on everything so therefore you
 

3055
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,710
its terms on everything so therefore you
start to absorb that and you start to

3056
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,720
start to absorb that and you start to
 

3057
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,080
start to absorb that and you start to
think oh well being really strict

3058

3063
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,210
error code five six two four nine is a
completely good error message because

3064

completely good error message because
 

3065
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,800
completely good error message because
that's what the computer gave me right

3066
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:55,810
that's what the computer gave me right
 

3067
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,680
that's what the computer gave me right
so you kind of forget to be a person at

3068
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:58,690
so you kind of forget to be a person at
 

3069
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,540
so you kind of forget to be a person at
some level and you know they say great

detectives internalized criminals and
 

3073
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,290
detectives internalized criminals and
kind of are criminals themselves like

kind of are criminals themselves like

00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,780
kind of are criminals themselves like
this trope of the master detective is

3076
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:06,790
this trope of the master detective is
 

3077
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,040
this trope of the master detective is
good because you can think like the

3078
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:08,050
good because you can think like the
 

3079
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,840
good because you can think like the
criminal well I do think that's true of

3080
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:09,850
criminal well I do think that's true of
 

3081
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:11,280
criminal well I do think that's true of
programmers really good programmers

3082
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,290
programmers really good programmers
 

3083
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,140
programmers really good programmers
think like the computer because that's

3084
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:13,150
think like the computer because that's
 

3085
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,540
think like the computer because that's
their job but if you internalize it too

3086
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:15,550
their job but if you internalize it too
 

3087
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,490
their job but if you internalize it too
much you become the computer you become

much you become the computer you become
 

3089
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,960

a kind of become a jerk to everybody
 

3091
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,330
a kind of become a jerk to everybody
because that's what you've internalized

3092
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:21,340
because that's what you've internalized
 

3093
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,490
because that's what you've internalized
you're almost not a jerk but you have no

3094
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:23,500
you're almost not a jerk but you have no
 

3095
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,770
you're almost not a jerk but you have no

00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,169
so there was just nowhere else to go
when you got stuck right like I had the

3250
00:50:58,169 --> 00:50:58,179
when you got stuck right like I had the
 

3251
00:50:58,179 --> 00:50:59,910
when you got stuck right like I had the
books that came with it I read those

3252
00:50:59,910 --> 00:50:59,920
books that came with it I read those
 

3253
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,979
books that came with it I read those
study those religiously I I just saw a

3254
00:51:01,979 --> 00:51:01,989
study those religiously I I just saw a
 

3255
00:51:01,989 --> 00:51:03,809
study those religiously I I just saw a
post from Steve Sinofsky that said this

00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:09,290
came with like 10,000 pages of written
 

3261
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,130
came with like 10,000 pages of written
material because where else were you

3262
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:12,140
material because where else were you
 

3263
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,840
material because where else were you
gonna figure that stuff out go to the

3264
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:13,850
gonna figure that stuff out go to the
 

3265
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:15,370
gonna figure that stuff out go to the
library I mean you don't have what

3266
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:15,380
library I mean you don't have what
 

3267
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,800

capito you didn't have you know read it

3268
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:17,810

you know were to go to answer these

3270
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:19,670
you know were to go to answer these
 

3271
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:21,990
you know were to go to answer these
questions so you you've talked about

3272
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:22,000
questions so you you've talked about
 

3273
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
questions so you you've talked about
through the years basically not having

3274
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,010
through the years basically not having
 

3275
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:28,210
through the years basically not having
an ego and not thinking that you're the

3276
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:28,220
an ego and not thinking that you're the
 

3277
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,220
an ego and not thinking that you're the
best programmer in the world it's always

3278
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:30,230
best programmer in the world it's always
 

3279
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:34,030
best programmer in the world it's always
kind of just looking to improve to

3280
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:34,040
kind of just looking to improve to
 

3281
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,650
kind of just looking to improve to
become a better programmer than you were

3282
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:35,660
become a better programmer than you were
 

3283
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,200
become a better programmer than you were
yesterday so how have you changed as a

3284
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:38,210
yesterday so how have you changed as a
 

3285
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:41,590
yesterday so how have you changed as a
programmer and as a as a thinker

3286
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:41,600
programmer and as a as a thinker
 

3287
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,900
programmer and as a as a thinker
designer around programming over it'll

3288
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:43,910
designer around programming over it'll
 

3289
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:47,950
designer around programming over it'll
past what is it 15 years really of being

00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:47,960
past what is it 15 years really of being

a public figure I would say the big

3292
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:49,880
a public figure I would say the big

insight that I had is eventually as a

00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:52,040
insight that I had is eventually as a
 

3295
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,380
insight that I had is eventually as a
programmer you have to kind of stop

3296
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:53,390
programmer you have to kind of stop
 

3297
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,970
programmer you have to kind of stop
writing code to be effective which is

3298
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:54,980
writing code to be effective which is
 

3299
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,340
writing code to be effective which is
kind of disturbing because you really

3300
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:57,350
kind of disturbing because you really
 

3301
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:59,230
kind of disturbing because you really
love it and but you realize like being

3302
00:51:59,230 --> 00:51:59,240
love it and but you realize like being
 

3303
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,200
love it and but you realize like being
effective at program at programming in

3304
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:02,210
effective at program at programming in
 

3305
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,900
effective at program at programming in
the general sense doesn't mean writing

3306
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:04,910
the general sense doesn't mean writing
 

3307
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:05,920
the general sense doesn't mean writing
code and a lot times you can be much

3308
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:05,930
code and a lot times you can be much
 

3309
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,110
code and a lot times you can be much
more successful by not writing code and

3310
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:08,120
more successful by not writing code and
 

3311
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,790
more successful by not writing code and
writing code in terms of just solving

3312
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:09,800
writing code in terms of just solving
 

3313
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,350
writing code in terms of just solving
the problems you have essentially hiring

3314
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:11,360
the problems you have essentially hiring
 

3315
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,580
the problems you have essentially hiring
people that are really good and like

3316
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:12,590
people that are really good and like
 

3317
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,830
people that are really good and like
setting them free and like giving them

3318
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:14,840
setting them free and like giving them
 

3319
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,020
setting them free and like giving them
basic direction right like on strategy

3320
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:17,030
basic direction right like on strategy
 

3321
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:18,820
basic direction right like on strategy
and stuff because a lot of the problems

3322
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:18,830
and stuff because a lot of the problems
 

3323
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,590
and stuff because a lot of the problems
you encounter aren't necessarily solved

3324
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:20,600
you encounter aren't necessarily solved
 

3325
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,480
you encounter aren't necessarily solved
through like really gnarly code they're

3326
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:22,490
through like really gnarly code they're
 

3327
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:25,240
through like really gnarly code they're
solved by conceptual solutions which can

3328
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:25,250
solved by conceptual solutions which can
 

3329
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,830
solved by conceptual solutions which can
then be turned into code but are you

3330
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:26,840
then be turned into code but are you
 

3331
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,830
then be turned into code but are you
even solving the right problem I mean so

3332
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:29,840
even solving the right problem I mean so
 

3333
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,530
even solving the right problem I mean so
I would say for me the main insight I

3334
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:32,540
I would say for me the main insight I
 

3335
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,010
I would say for me the main insight I
have is to succeed as a programmer you

3336
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:35,020
have is to succeed as a programmer you
 

3337
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,390
have is to succeed as a programmer you
eventually kind of stop writing code

3338
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:37,400
eventually kind of stop writing code
 

3339
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,130
eventually kind of stop writing code
that's gonna sound discouraging probably

3340
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:39,140
that's gonna sound discouraging probably
 

3341
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,480
that's gonna sound discouraging probably
to people hearing but I don't mean it

3342
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:40,490
to people hearing but I don't mean it
 

3343
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,740
to people hearing but I don't mean it
that way what I mean is that you're

3344
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:41,750
that way what I mean is that you're
 

3345
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:42,700
that way what I mean is that you're
coding at a higher level language

3346
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:42,710
coding at a higher level language
 

3347
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,800
coding at a higher level language
eventually like okay so we're coding an

3348
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:44,810
eventually like okay so we're coding an
 

3349
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:45,820
eventually like okay so we're coding an
assembly language right that's the

3350
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:45,830
assembly language right that's the
 

3351
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,800
assembly language right that's the
beginning right you're hard coded to the

3352
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:47,810
beginning right you're hard coded to the
 

3353
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:49,360
beginning right you're hard coded to the
architecture then you have stuff like

3354
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:49,370
architecture then you have stuff like
 

3355
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,130
architecture then you have stuff like
see we're cool we can abstract across

3356
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:51,140
see we're cool we can abstract across
 

3357
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,510
see we're cool we can abstract across
the architecture you can write code I

3358
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:52,520
the architecture you can write code I
 

3359
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,730
the architecture you can write code I
can then compile that code for arm or

3360
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:54,740
can then compile that code for arm or
 

3361
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,860
can then compile that code for arm or
you know you know whatever you know x86

3362
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:56,870
you know you know whatever you know x86
 

3363
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,540
you know you know whatever you know x86
or whatever else is out there and then

3364
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:58,550
or whatever else is out there and then
 

3365
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,640
or whatever else is out there and then
even higher level net right like you're

3366
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:00,650
even higher level net right like you're
 

3367
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,290
even higher level net right like you're
looking like Python Ruby interpreted

3368
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:02,300
looking like Python Ruby interpreted
 

3369
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,630
looking like Python Ruby interpreted
languages and then to me as a programmer

3370
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:04,640
languages and then to me as a programmer
 

3371
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,680
languages and then to me as a programmer
like okay I want to go even higher

3372
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:05,690
like okay I want to go even higher
 

3373
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,390
like okay I want to go even higher
I want to go higher than that how do I

3374
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:07,400
I want to go higher than that how do I
 

3375
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,650
I want to go higher than that how do I
abstract higher than the language it's

3376
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:08,660
abstract higher than the language it's
 

3377
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,270
abstract higher than the language it's
like well you abstract in spoken

3378
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:10,280
like well you abstract in spoken
 

3379
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,220
like well you abstract in spoken
language and written language right like

3380
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:12,230
language and written language right like
 

3381
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,080
language and written language right like
you're sort of inspiring people to get

3382
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:14,090
you're sort of inspiring people to get
 

3383
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,400
you're sort of inspiring people to get
things done giving them guidance like

3384
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:15,410
things done giving them guidance like
 

3385
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:16,620
things done giving them guidance like
what if we did this what if we did this

3386
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:16,630
what if we did this what if we did this
 

3387
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,790
what if we did this what if we did this
you're writing in the highest level

3388
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:18,800
you're writing in the highest level
 

3389
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,480
you're writing in the highest level
language that there is

3390
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:19,490
language that there is
 

3391
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,460
language that there is
which is for me English right whatever

3392
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:21,470
which is for me English right whatever
 

3393
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:24,370
which is for me English right whatever
your spoken language is so it's all

3394
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:24,380
your spoken language is so it's all
 

3395
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:26,170
your spoken language is so it's all
about being effective right and I think

3396
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:26,180
about being effective right and I think
 

3397
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,640
about being effective right and I think

it's about code which doesn't really
 

3427
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,700
it's about code which doesn't really
make sense right but it's about can

was working on early on the blog were

3450
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:16,369
was working on early on the blog were
 

3451
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:18,850
was working on early on the blog were
about figuring out the people parts of

3452
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:18,860
about figuring out the people parts of
 

3453
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,380
about figuring out the people parts of
programming which were the harder parts

3454
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:20,390
programming which were the harder parts
 

3455
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,820
programming which were the harder parts
the hard part of programming once you

3456
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:21,830
the hard part of programming once you
 

3457
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:23,020
the hard part of programming once you
get to a certain skill of in programming

3458
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,030
get to a certain skill of in programming
 

3459
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,760
get to a certain skill of in programming
you can pretty much solve any reasonable

3460
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:24,770
you can pretty much solve any reasonable
 

3461
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:25,990
you can pretty much solve any reasonable
problem that's put in front of you

3462
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:26,000
problem that's put in front of you
 

3463
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,460
problem that's put in front of you
you're not writing algorithms from

3464
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:27,470
you're not writing algorithms from
 

3465
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,630
you're not writing algorithms from
scratch right that just doesn't happen

so any sort of reasonable problem for in

3468
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:31,040
so any sort of reasonable problem for in
 

3469
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:31,990
so any sort of reasonable problem for in
front of you're gonna be able to solve

00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:32,000
front of you're gonna be able to solve
 

3471
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,330
front of you're gonna be able to solve
but what you can't solve is our manager

is a total jerk you cannot solve that
 

3475
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,480
is a total jerk you cannot solve that
with code that is not a codes problem

00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:03,200
freaked out right these are the problems
 

3501
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,140
freaked out right these are the problems
that you have to attack absolutely and

that you have to attack absolutely and
 

3503
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:06,640
that you have to attack absolutely and
so as you go to these higher level

abstractions as you developed as a
 

3507
00:55:08,359 --> 00:55:09,940
abstractions as you developed as a
programmer to higher higher level

of the lower level of just building is
 

3527
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,090
of the lower level of just building is
like do you worry about that you know

3528

is always that paranoia and oh gosh I
 

3535
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:45,730
is always that paranoia and oh gosh I
don't feel as valuable since I'm not

don't feel as valuable since I'm not
 

3537
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,200
don't feel as valuable since I'm not
writing code but for me like when we

3538
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:47,210
writing code but for me like when we
 

3539
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,370
writing code but for me like when we
started the discourse project it was

3540
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:48,380
started the discourse project it was
 

3541

was working in that's what we built

3552
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:57,140
was working in that's what we built
 

3553
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,720
was working in that's what we built
Stack Overflow and and still is written

3554
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:58,730
Stack Overflow and and still is written
 

3555

traces right like I have all the
 

3567
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,950
traces right like I have all the
fundamental concepts to be a programmer

fundamental concepts to be a programmer
I just don't know Ruby so I'm still on a

3570
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:14,090
I just don't know Ruby so I'm still on a
 

3571
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:15,550
I just don't know Ruby so I'm still on a
higher level I'm not like a beginner

3572
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:15,560
higher level I'm not like a beginner
 

3573

beginner like you're saying I'm just
 

3575
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,190
beginner like you're saying I'm just
like I need to apply my programming

3576
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:18,200
like I need to apply my programming
 

3577
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,560
like I need to apply my programming
concepts I already know to Ruby what so

3578
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:20,570
concepts I already know to Ruby what so
 

3579
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:21,880

there's a question that's really

3580
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:21,890
there's a question that's really
 

3581
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:25,150
there's a question that's really
interesting so looking at Ruby how do

like what I realized written when I

3590
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:31,340
like what I realized written when I
 

3591
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,710
like what I realized written when I
started was just me and Robin I realized

the answer to both of those was

3608
00:56:50,109 --> 00:56:50,119
the answer to both of those was
 

3609
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:53,349
the answer to both of those was
resoundingly no right like we were

resoundingly no right like we were
 

3611
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:54,760
resoundingly no right like we were
getting to an alpha and it was a pretty

right like we eventually hired Neil and

3616
00:56:59,230 --> 00:56:59,240
right like we eventually hired Neil and
 

3617
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,820
right like we eventually hired Neil and
then eventually Sam who came in as a

Neil later but the answer of the problem

3622
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:06,050
Neil later but the answer of the problem
 

3623
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:07,510
Neil later but the answer of the problem
is just hire other competent programmers

3624

what do we even want to build there's a
 

3649
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,390
what do we even want to build there's a
little bit of that that goes on then

very quickly get to the prototype stage

3652
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:32,720
very quickly get to the prototype stage
 

3653
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,490
very quickly get to the prototype stage
like build a prototype

like build a prototype
let's iterate on the prototype really

3656
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,030
let's iterate on the prototype really
 

3657
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,550
let's iterate on the prototype really
really rapidly that's what we do at this

00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:36,560
really rapidly that's what we do at this
 

3659
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,960
really rapidly that's what we do at this
course and that's what we we demoed to

3660
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:37,970
course and that's what we we demoed to
 

3661
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,550
course and that's what we we demoed to
get our seed funding for this course was

the the alpha version of discourse that
 

3665
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:43,930
the the alpha version of discourse that
we had running and ready to go and it

00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:43,940
we had running and ready to go and it
 

3667
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,130
we had running and ready to go and it
was very it was bad

was very it was bad
 

3669
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,359
was very it was bad
I mean it was I'll just tell you it was

00:57:46,359 --> 00:57:46,369
I mean it was I'll just tell you it was
 

3671
00:57:46,369 --> 00:57:48,519
I mean it was I'll just tell you it was
bad I have we have screenshots and I'm

3672
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:48,529
bad I have we have screenshots and I'm
 

3673

bad I have we have screenshots and I'm
just like embarrassed to look at it now

00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:49,700
just like embarrassed to look at it now
 

3675
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,549
just like embarrassed to look at it now
but it was the prototype we were

3676
00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:51,559
but it was the prototype we were
 

3677
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:52,750
but it was the prototype we were
figuring out like what's working what's

3678
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:52,760
figuring out like what's working what's
 

3679
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,730
figuring out like what's working what's
not working because there's such a broad

not working because there's such a broad
 

3681
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:58,420

00:57:59,769 --> 00:57:59,779
things will work in your mind or even on
 

3685
00:57:59,779 --> 00:58:01,839
things will work in your mind or even on
paper and the way they work once you sit

paper and the way they work once you sit
 

3687
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:03,730

00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:03,740
and live in the software like actually
 

3689
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,470
and live in the software like actually
spend time living and breathing us out

we're so different
 

3693
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,660
we're so different
so my philosophy is get to a prototype

3694
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:10,670
so my philosophy is get to a prototype
 

3695
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:12,279
so my philosophy is get to a prototype
and then what you're really optimizing

3696
00:58:12,279 --> 00:58:12,289
and then what you're really optimizing
 

3697
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:13,690
and then what you're really optimizing
for speed of iteration like how you can

3698
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:13,700
for speed of iteration like how you can
 

3699
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,670
for speed of iteration like how you can
turn the crank how quickly can we

3700
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:15,680
turn the crank how quickly can we
 

3701
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,680
turn the crank how quickly can we
iterate that's the absolutely critical

3702
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:17,690
iterate that's the absolutely critical
 

3703
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,480
iterate that's the absolutely critical
metric of any software project and I had

3704
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:19,490
metric of any software project and I had
 

3705
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:21,069
metric of any software project and I had
a tweet recently that people liked and I

3706

3753
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,220
cuz we're bored it's like this is an
awesome change and then it takes a you

3754
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:06,230
awesome change and then it takes a you
 

3755
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:07,299
awesome change and then it takes a you
know months to roll out it's like what

3756
00:59:07,299 --> 00:59:07,309
know months to roll out it's like what
 

3757
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:09,279
know months to roll out it's like what
you're dead like you can't iterate you

3758
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:09,289
you're dead like you can't iterate you
 

3759
00:59:09,289 --> 00:59:12,759
you're dead like you can't iterate you
can't do anything right like so anyway

3760
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:12,769
can't do anything right like so anyway
 

3761
00:59:12,769 --> 00:59:14,289
can't do anything right like so anyway
about the heartbeat it's like get the

3762
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:14,299
about the heartbeat it's like get the
 

3763
00:59:14,299 --> 00:59:15,940
about the heartbeat it's like get the
the prototype and then iterate on it

3764
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:15,950
the prototype and then iterate on it
 

3765
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:17,680
the prototype and then iterate on it
that's that's what I view is like the

3766
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:17,690
that's that's what I view is like the
 

3767
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,749
that's that's what I view is like the
central tenets of some modern software

00:59:19,749 --> 00:59:19,759
central tenets of some modern software
 

3769
00:59:19,759 --> 00:59:21,579
central tenets of some modern software
development that's fascinating you put

00:59:21,579 --> 00:59:21,589
development that's fascinating you put
 

3771
00:59:21,589 --> 00:59:23,019
development that's fascinating you put
it that way it's actually so I work in I

00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:23,029
it that way it's actually so I work in I
 

3773

freaking out but like it is a measure of
 

3809
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:06,220

listening this decide what that means
 

3815
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,140
listening this decide what that means
but it has to be healthy has to be

but it has to be healthy has to be
 

3817
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,640
but it has to be healthy has to be
reasonable because otherwise you just

reasonable because otherwise you just
 

3819
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,960
reasonable because otherwise you just
get me frustrated because like that's

3820
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:13,970
get me frustrated because like that's
 

3821
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,790
get me frustrated because like that's
how you build software you make mistakes

01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,800
makes this stuff great is that it can be
changed so rapidly and become something

3866
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:56,810
changed so rapidly and become something
 

3867
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:58,510
changed so rapidly and become something
that that is greater than it is now now

3868
01:00:58,510 --> 01:00:58,520
that that is greater than it is now now
 

3869
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,070
that that is greater than it is now now
credit there's some changes that suck I

3870
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:00,080
credit there's some changes that suck I
 

3871
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,470
credit there's some changes that suck I
admit I've seen it many times but in

3872
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:02,480
admit I've seen it many times but in
 

3873
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,000
admit I've seen it many times but in
general it's like that's what makes

3874
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,010
general it's like that's what makes
 

3875
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:05,800
general it's like that's what makes
software cool right is that it is so

3876
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:05,810
software cool right is that it is so
 

3877
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:07,630
software cool right is that it is so
malleable like fighting that is like

3878
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:07,640
malleable like fighting that is like
 

3879
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,980
malleable like fighting that is like
weird to me because it's like well

3880
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:08,990
weird to me because it's like well
 

3881
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:10,840
weird to me because it's like well
you're fighting the essence of the thing

3882
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:10,850
you're fighting the essence of the thing
 

3883
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:12,490
you're fighting the essence of the thing
that you're building like that doesn't

3884
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:12,500
that you're building like that doesn't
 

3885
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,630
that you're building like that doesn't
make sense you want to really embrace

3886
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:13,640
make sense you want to really embrace
 

3887
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,550
make sense you want to really embrace
that not not to be a hummingbird but

3888
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:15,560
that not not to be a hummingbird but
 

3889
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,260
that not not to be a hummingbird but
like embrace it to a healthy cycle of

3890
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:17,270
like embrace it to a healthy cycle of
 

3891
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:18,730
like embrace it to a healthy cycle of
your heartbeat right so you talk about

3892
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:18,740
your heartbeat right so you talk about
 

3893
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:21,099
your heartbeat right so you talk about
that people really don't change it's

3894
01:01:21,099 --> 01:01:21,109
that people really don't change it's
 

3895
01:01:21,109 --> 01:01:21,640
that people really don't change it's
true

3896
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:21,650
true
 

3897
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,920
true
that's why probably a lot of the stuff

3898
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:23,930
that's why probably a lot of the stuff
 

3899
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,020
that's why probably a lot of the stuff
you write about in your blog probably

3900
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:26,030
you write about in your blog probably
 

3901
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:28,450
you write about in your blog probably
will remain true there's a flip side of

3902
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:28,460
will remain true there's a flip side of
 

3903
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,470
will remain true there's a flip side of
the coin people don't change so

3904
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:29,480
the coin people don't change so
 

3905
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,020
the coin people don't change so
investing and understanding people is is

3906
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:32,030
investing and understanding people is is
 

3907
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:35,920
investing and understanding people is is
like learning Unix in 1970 because and

3908
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:35,930
like learning Unix in 1970 because and
 

3909
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:37,540
like learning Unix in 1970 because and
nothing has changed right like yeah all

3910
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:37,550
nothing has changed right like yeah all
 

3911
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:38,710
nothing has changed right like yeah all
those things you've learned about people

3912
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:38,720
those things you've learned about people
 

3913
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,540
those things you've learned about people
will still be valid 30 40 years from now

3914
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:40,550
will still be valid 30 40 years from now
 

3915
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:41,920
will still be valid 30 40 years from now
whereas if you learn the latest

3916
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:41,930
whereas if you learn the latest
 

3917
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:43,660
whereas if you learn the latest
JavaScript framework that's gonna be

3918
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:43,670
JavaScript framework that's gonna be
 

3919
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:44,620
JavaScript framework that's gonna be
good for like two years

3920
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:44,630
good for like two years
 

3921
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:47,650
good for like two years
right yeah exactly so but if you look at

3922
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:47,660
right yeah exactly so but if you look at
 

3923
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:50,170
right yeah exactly so but if you look at
the future of programming so there's a

3924
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:50,180
the future of programming so there's a
 

3925
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:53,020
the future of programming so there's a
people component but there's also the

3926
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:53,030
people component but there's also the
 

3927
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:55,720
people component but there's also the
technology itself do you what do you see

3928
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:55,730
technology itself do you what do you see
 

3929
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:57,640
technology itself do you what do you see
as the future of programming will it

3930
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:57,650
as the future of programming will it
 

3931
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:00,099
as the future of programming will it
change significantly or as as far as you

3932
01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:00,109
change significantly or as as far as you
 

3933
01:02:00,109 --> 01:02:03,720
change significantly or as as far as you
can tell people are ultimately

3934
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:03,730
can tell people are ultimately
 

3935
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:06,490
can tell people are ultimately
programming and so it will not it's not

3936
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:06,500
programming and so it will not it's not
 

3937
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,830
programming and so it will not it's not
something that you foresee changing and

3938
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:08,840
something that you foresee changing and
 

3939
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,960
something that you foresee changing and
you fund the month away well you gotta

3940
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:10,970
you fund the month away well you gotta
 

3941
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:11,820
you fund the month away well you gotta
go look

3942
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:11,830
go look
 

3943
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:14,490
go look
on sort of the basics of programming and

3944
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:14,500
on sort of the basics of programming and
 

3945
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,600
on sort of the basics of programming and
one things that always shocked me is

3946
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:15,610
one things that always shocked me is
 

3947
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:16,890
one things that always shocked me is
like source control like I didn't learn

3948
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:16,900
like source control like I didn't learn
 

3949
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,440
like source control like I didn't learn
anything about source control I graduate

3950
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,450
anything about source control I graduate
 

3951
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:23,640
anything about source control I graduate
from college in 1992 but I remember

3952
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:23,650
from college in 1992 but I remember
 

3953
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:25,170
from college in 1992 but I remember
hearing from people like in ladies like

3954
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:25,180
hearing from people like in ladies like
 

3955
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:27,720
hearing from people like in ladies like
1998-99 like even maybe today they're

3956
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:27,730
1998-99 like even maybe today they're
 

3957
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:29,160
1998-99 like even maybe today they're
not learning source control and to me

3958
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:29,170
not learning source control and to me
 

3959
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:30,360
not learning source control and to me
it's like well how can you not learn

3960
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:30,370
it's like well how can you not learn
 

3961
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:32,670
it's like well how can you not learn
source control that is so fundamental to

3962
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:32,680
source control that is so fundamental to
 

3963
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,800
source control that is so fundamental to
working with other programmers working

3964
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:34,810
working with other programmers working
 

3965
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:36,120
working with other programmers working
in a way they don't lose your work like

3966
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:36,130
in a way they don't lose your work like
 

3967
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:38,490
in a way they don't lose your work like
just just basics off the bed literal

3968
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:38,500
just just basics off the bed literal
 

3969
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,710
just just basics off the bed literal
bedrock software development is source

3970
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:40,720
bedrock software development is source
 

3971
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,270
bedrock software development is source
control now you compare today like

3972
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:42,280
control now you compare today like
 

3973
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,590
control now you compare today like
github right like Microsoft brought

3974
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:43,600
github right like Microsoft brought
 

3975
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,490
github right like Microsoft brought
github which I think was incredibly

3976
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:44,500
github which I think was incredibly
 

3977
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,130
github which I think was incredibly
smart acquisition move on their part now

3978
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:47,140
smart acquisition move on their part now
 

3979
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,080
smart acquisition move on their part now
they have anybody who wants like

3980
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:49,090
they have anybody who wants like
 

3981
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:50,400
they have anybody who wants like
reasonable source control to go sign

3982
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:50,410
reasonable source control to go sign
 

3983
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:51,780
reasonable source control to go sign
them and github it's all set up for you

3984
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:51,790
them and github it's all set up for you
 

3985
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:54,210
them and github it's all set up for you
right there's tons of walkthroughs tons

3986
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:54,220
right there's tons of walkthroughs tons
 

3987
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,340
right there's tons of walkthroughs tons
of tutorials so from the concept of like

3988
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:56,350
of tutorials so from the concept of like
 

3989
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:58,620
of tutorials so from the concept of like
has programming advanced from say 1999

3990
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:58,630
has programming advanced from say 1999
 

3991
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:00,270
has programming advanced from say 1999
it's like well hell we have github I

3992
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:00,280
it's like well hell we have github I
 

3993
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,100
it's like well hell we have github I
mean my god yes right like it's it's

3994
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:02,110
mean my god yes right like it's it's
 

3995
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:04,470
mean my god yes right like it's it's
massively advanced over over what it was

3996
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:04,480
massively advanced over over what it was
 

3997
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,050
massively advanced over over what it was
now as to whether program is is

3998
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:07,060
now as to whether program is is
 

3999
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,540
now as to whether program is is
significantly different I'm gonna say no

4000
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:09,550
significantly different I'm gonna say no
 

4001
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:11,790
significantly different I'm gonna say no
but I think the baseline of like what we

4002
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:11,800
but I think the baseline of like what we
 

4003
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,000
but I think the baseline of like what we
view is like fundamentals will continue

4004
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:15,010
view is like fundamentals will continue
 

4005
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:16,680
view is like fundamentals will continue
to go up and actually get better like

4006
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:16,690
to go up and actually get better like
 

4007
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:18,060
to go up and actually get better like
source control that's one of them in

4008
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:18,070
source control that's one of them in
 

4009
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:19,820
source control that's one of them in
fundamentals that has gotten I mean

4010
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:19,830
fundamentals that has gotten I mean
 

4011
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,810
fundamentals that has gotten I mean
hundreds of orders of magnitude better

4012
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:21,820
hundreds of orders of magnitude better
 

4013
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,150
hundreds of orders of magnitude better
than it was 10 20 years ago so those are

4014
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:24,160
than it was 10 20 years ago so those are
 

4015
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,100
than it was 10 20 years ago so those are
the fundamentals let me introduce two

4016
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:26,110
the fundamentals let me introduce two
 

4017
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:28,410
the fundamentals let me introduce two
things that maybe you can comment on so

4018
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:28,420
things that maybe you can comment on so
 

4019
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,610
things that maybe you can comment on so
one is mobile phones so that could

4020
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:31,620
one is mobile phones so that could
 

4021
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:36,120
one is mobile phones so that could
fundamentally transform what what

4022
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:36,130
fundamentally transform what what
 

4023
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:38,250
fundamentally transform what what
programming is or maybe not maybe you

4024
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:38,260
programming is or maybe not maybe you
 

4025
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:39,930
programming is or maybe not maybe you
can comment on that and the other one is

4026
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:39,940
can comment on that and the other one is
 

4027
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:42,570
can comment on that and the other one is
artificial intelligence which promises

4028
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:42,580
artificial intelligence which promises
 

4029
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:46,860
artificial intelligence which promises
to in some ways to do some of the

4030
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:46,870
to in some ways to do some of the
 

4031
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:48,630
to in some ways to do some of the
programming for you is one way to think

4032
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:48,640
programming for you is one way to think
 

4033
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,910
programming for you is one way to think
about it so it's really what a

4034
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:50,920
about it so it's really what a
 

4035
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,420
about it so it's really what a
programmer is is using the intelligence

4036
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:54,430
programmer is is using the intelligence
 

4037
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,000
programmer is is using the intelligence
that's inside your skull to do something

4038
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,010
that's inside your skull to do something
 

4039
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:58,770
that's inside your skull to do something
useful the hope with artificial

4040
01:03:58,770 --> 01:03:58,780
useful the hope with artificial
 

4041
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,900
useful the hope with artificial
intelligence is that it does some of the

4042
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:00,910
intelligence is that it does some of the
 

4043
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:02,670
intelligence is that it does some of the
useful parts for you you don't have to

4044
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:02,680
useful parts for you you don't have to
 

4045
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,640
useful parts for you you don't have to
think about it so do you see smart

4046
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:05,650
think about it so do you see smart
 

4047
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,110
think about it so do you see smart
phones the fact that everybody has one

4048
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:07,120
phones the fact that everybody has one
 

4049
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,610
phones the fact that everybody has one
and they're getting more and more

4050
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:08,620
and they're getting more and more
 

4051
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,530
and they're getting more and more
powerful as potentially changing

4052
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:10,540
powerful as potentially changing
 

4053
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:12,660
powerful as potentially changing
programming and do you see AI is

4054
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:12,670
programming and do you see AI is
 

4055
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:14,850
programming and do you see AI is
potentially changing problem okay so

4056
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:14,860
potentially changing problem okay so
 

4057
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,470
potentially changing problem okay so
that's good so smart phones have

4058
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:16,480
that's good so smart phones have
 

4059
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,450
that's good so smart phones have
definitely changed I mean since you know

4060
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:18,460
definitely changed I mean since you know
 

4061
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,980
definitely changed I mean since you know
I guess 2010 that's when they really

4062
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:19,990
I guess 2010 that's when they really
 

4063
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:22,410
I guess 2010 that's when they really
started getting super popular I mean in

4064
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:22,420
started getting super popular I mean in
 

4065
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:24,780
started getting super popular I mean in
the last eight years the world has

4066
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:24,790
the last eight years the world has
 

4067
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:25,650
the last eight years the world has
literally changed

4068
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:25,660
literally changed
 

4069
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,210
literally changed
like everybody carries a computer around

4070
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:27,220
like everybody carries a computer around
 

4071
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:29,400
like everybody carries a computer around
and that's normal I mean that is such a

4072
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:29,410
and that's normal I mean that is such a
 

4073
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:31,620
and that's normal I mean that is such a
huge change in society I think we're

4074
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:31,630
huge change in society I think we're
 

4075
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:33,750
huge change in society I think we're
still dealing with a lot of the positive

4076
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:33,760
still dealing with a lot of the positive
 

4077
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,099
still dealing with a lot of the positive
negative ramifications of that right

4078
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:35,109
negative ramifications of that right
 

4079
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:36,059
negative ramifications of that right
like everybody's connected all the time

4080
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:36,069
like everybody's connected all the time
 

4081
01:04:36,069 --> 01:04:37,380
like everybody's connected all the time
everybody's on the computer all the time

4082
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:37,390
everybody's on the computer all the time
 

4083
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:39,900
everybody's on the computer all the time
that was my dream world as a geek right

4084
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:39,910
that was my dream world as a geek right
 

4085
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:41,339
that was my dream world as a geek right
but it's like be careful what you ask

4086
01:04:41,339 --> 01:04:41,349
but it's like be careful what you ask
 

4087
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:43,710
but it's like be careful what you ask
for right like wow no everybody's a

4088
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:43,720
for right like wow no everybody's a
 

4089
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,299
for right like wow no everybody's a
computer it's not quite the utopia that

4090
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:45,309
computer it's not quite the utopia that
 

4091
01:04:45,309 --> 01:04:47,370
computer it's not quite the utopia that
we thought it would be right computers

4092
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:47,380
we thought it would be right computers
 

4093
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:48,630
we thought it would be right computers
can be used for a lot of stuff that's

4094
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:48,640
can be used for a lot of stuff that's
 

4095
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,599
can be used for a lot of stuff that's
not necessarily great so to me that's

4096
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:51,609
not necessarily great so to me that's
 

4097
01:04:51,609 --> 01:04:53,220
not necessarily great so to me that's
the central focus of the smartphone is

4098
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:53,230
the central focus of the smartphone is
 

4099
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,170
the central focus of the smartphone is
just that it puts a computer in front of

4100
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:55,180
just that it puts a computer in front of
 

4101
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:55,680
just that it puts a computer in front of

like you want to teach these basic
 

4117
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:10,799
like you want to teach these basic
command line things and that is just

01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:10,809
command line things and that is just
 

4119
01:05:10,809 --> 01:05:12,779
command line things and that is just
what programmers gonna be for I think a

4120
01:05:12,779 --> 01:05:12,789
what programmers gonna be for I think a

01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:15,029
what programmers gonna be for I think a
long long time I don't think there's any

long long time I don't think there's any

long long time I don't think there's any
magical like visual programming that's

magical like visual programming that's
 

4125
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,730
magical like visual programming that's
gonna happen I just I don't know I've

gonna happen I just I don't know I've

over time I've become a believer in that

over time I've become a believer in that

01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:24,059
over time I've become a believer in that
UNIX philosophy it was just you know

4130
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:24,069
UNIX philosophy it was just you know
 

4131
01:05:24,069 --> 01:05:25,650
UNIX philosophy it was just you know
they kind of had it right with UNIX

4132
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:25,660
they kind of had it right with UNIX
 

4133
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,990
they kind of had it right with UNIX
that's gonna be the way it hits for a

4134
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,000
that's gonna be the way it hits for a
 

4135
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,940
that's gonna be the way it hits for a
long long time and well we'll continue

4136
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:29,950
long long time and well we'll continue
 

4137
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:31,680
long long time and well we'll continue
to like I said raise the baseline the

4138
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:31,690
to like I said raise the baseline the
 

4139
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:32,940
to like I said raise the baseline the
tools will get better it'll get simpler

4140
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:32,950
tools will get better it'll get simpler
 

4141
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:33,990
tools will get better it'll get simpler
but it's still fun mental gonna be

4142
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:34,000
but it's still fun mental gonna be
 

4143
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,510
but it's still fun mental gonna be
command-line tools you know makes fancy

4144
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:36,520
command-line tools you know makes fancy

01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,430
command-line tools you know makes fancy
IDs that's kind of it for the

4146
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:38,440
IDs that's kind of it for the
 

4147
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,779
IDs that's kind of it for the
foreseeable future I'm not seeing any

4148
01:05:39,779 --> 01:05:39,789
foreseeable future I'm not seeing any
 

4149
01:05:39,789 --> 01:05:41,640
foreseeable future I'm not seeing any
visual programming stuff on the horizon

4150
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:41,650
visual programming stuff on the horizon
 

4151
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:43,319
visual programming stuff on the horizon
because you can I think like what do you

4152
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:43,329
because you can I think like what do you
 

4153
01:05:43,329 --> 01:05:44,970
because you can I think like what do you
do on a smartphone that will be directly

4154
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:44,980
do on a smartphone that will be directly
 

4155
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,799
do on a smartphone that will be directly
analogous to programming like I'm trying

4156
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:46,809
analogous to programming like I'm trying
 

4157
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:48,569
analogous to programming like I'm trying
to think right like and there's really

4158
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:48,579
to think right like and there's really
 

4159
01:05:48,579 --> 01:05:54,660
to think right like and there's really
not much so not necessarily analogous to

4160
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:54,670
not much so not necessarily analogous to
 

4161
01:05:54,670 --> 01:06:00,089
not much so not necessarily analogous to
programming but the kind of things that

4162
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:00,099
programming but the kind of things that
 

4163
01:06:00,099 --> 01:06:02,069
programming but the kind of things that
the kind of programs you would need to

4164
01:06:02,069 --> 01:06:02,079
the kind of programs you would need to
 

4165
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:06,500
the kind of programs you would need to
write might need to be very different

4166
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:06,510
write might need to be very different
 

4167
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:09,690
write might need to be very different
yeah and the kind of language is I mean

4168
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:09,700
yeah and the kind of language is I mean
 

4169
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,789
yeah and the kind of language is I mean
but I probably also subscribed to the

4170
01:06:11,789 --> 01:06:11,799
but I probably also subscribed to the
 

4171
01:06:11,799 --> 01:06:13,890
but I probably also subscribed to the
same just because everything in this

4172
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:13,900
same just because everything in this
 

4173
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,049
same just because everything in this
world might be written in JavaScript

4174
01:06:16,049 --> 01:06:16,059
world might be written in JavaScript
 

4175
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:17,339
world might be written in JavaScript
oh yeah that's different that's already

4176
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:17,349
oh yeah that's different that's already
 

4177

oh yeah that's different that's already
happening I mean this course is a bit on

01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:21,809
discourses itself javascript is another
bet on that side of the table and I

4182
01:06:21,809 --> 01:06:21,819
bet on that side of the table and I
 

4183
01:06:21,819 --> 01:06:23,760
bet on that side of the table and I
still strongly believe in that so I

4184
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:23,770
still strongly believe in that so I
 

4185
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:25,049
still strongly believe in that so I
would say smartphones have mostly a

4186
01:06:25,049 --> 01:06:25,059
would say smartphones have mostly a
 

4187
01:06:25,059 --> 01:06:26,549
would say smartphones have mostly a
cultural shift more than a programming

4188
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:26,559
cultural shift more than a programming
 

4189
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,769
cultural shift more than a programming
shift now your other question was about

4190
01:06:28,769 --> 01:06:28,779
shift now your other question was about
 

4191
01:06:28,779 --> 01:06:31,620
shift now your other question was about
artificial intelligence and like sort of

4192
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:31,630
artificial intelligence and like sort of
 

4193
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:33,000
artificial intelligence and like sort of
devices predicting what you're gonna do

4194
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:33,010
devices predicting what you're gonna do
 

4195
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:34,440
devices predicting what you're gonna do
and I do think there's some strengths to

4196
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:34,450
and I do think there's some strengths to
 

4197
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,000
and I do think there's some strengths to
that I think artificial intelligence

4198
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,010
that I think artificial intelligence
 

4199
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:37,440
that I think artificial intelligence
kind of overselling it in terms of what

4200
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:37,450
kind of overselling it in terms of what
 

4201
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:38,579
kind of overselling it in terms of what
it's doing it's more like people are

4202
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:38,589
it's doing it's more like people are
 

4203
01:06:38,589 --> 01:06:39,330
it's doing it's more like people are
predictable right

4204
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:39,340
predictable right
 

4205
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,280
predictable right
people do the same things like let me

01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:48,820
big commercial websites is say you log
 

4213
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,630
big commercial websites is say you log
in from New York City now and then an

in from New York City now and then an
 

4215
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,670

like well hmm that's interesting how did

4218
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:56,860
like well hmm that's interesting how did

you get from New York to San Francisco

4220
01:06:58,770 --> 01:06:58,780
you get from New York to San Francisco
 

4221
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,720
you get from New York to San Francisco
in one hour so at that point you're like

4222
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:00,730
in one hour so at that point you're like
 

4223
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:02,430
in one hour so at that point you're like
okay this is a suspicious login at that

4224
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:02,440
okay this is a suspicious login at that
 

4225
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,480
okay this is a suspicious login at that
point so we would alert you it's like

point so we would alert you it's like
 

4227
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:05,550
point so we would alert you it's like
okay but that's an AI right that's just

4228
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:05,560
okay but that's an AI right that's just
 

4229
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,310
okay but that's an AI right that's just
a heuristic of like how did you in one

4230
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:08,320
a heuristic of like how did you in one
 

4231
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,460
a heuristic of like how did you in one
hour get 2,000 miles right that doesn't

01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:11,470
hour get 2,000 miles right that doesn't

01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,780
there's other races happen but that's
just a basic prediction based on the

01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:15,790
just a basic prediction based on the
 

4239
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:18,000
just a basic prediction based on the
idea that people pretty much don't move

01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,010
idea that people pretty much don't move

that's literally we're traveling the
 

4249
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,580
that's literally we're traveling the

01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:29,890
of things you're going to do and I think
 

4255
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:32,070
of things you're going to do and I think
good software anticipate your needs like

4256
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:32,080
good software anticipate your needs like
 

4257
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,690
good software anticipate your needs like
for example Google I think it's called

01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:33,700
for example Google I think it's called
 

4259
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,160
for example Google I think it's called
Google now or whatever that Google thing

Google now or whatever that Google thing
 

4261
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,270
Google now or whatever that Google thing
is that predicts your commute and

location like where are you every day
 

4267
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,520
location like where are you every day
well that's probably where you work that

4268
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:41,530
well that's probably where you work that
 

4269
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:42,930
well that's probably where you work that
kind of stuff I do think computers can

4270
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:42,940
kind of stuff I do think computers can
 

4271
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:44,370
kind of stuff I do think computers can
get a lot better at that but I hesitate

4272
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:44,380
get a lot better at that but I hesitate
 

4273
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:46,560
get a lot better at that but I hesitate
to call it like full-blown AI it's just

4274
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:46,570
to call it like full-blown AI it's just
 

4275
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:48,720
to call it like full-blown AI it's just
computers getting better at like first

4276
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:48,730
computers getting better at like first
 

4277

of all they have a ton of because every

has a smartphone now I'm suddenly how

4280
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:51,130
has a smartphone now I'm suddenly how
 

4281
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:52,740
has a smartphone now I'm suddenly how
all this data that we didn't have before

01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:52,750
all this data that we didn't have before
 

4283
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:54,660
all this data that we didn't have before
about location about like you know

4284
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:54,670
about location about like you know

some basic heuristics and maybe some
fancy algorithms that turn it into

like like a friend would write like oh

4294
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:04,780
like like a friend would write like oh
 

4295
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,810
like like a friend would write like oh
hey I I see your home would you like

4296
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:06,820
hey I I see your home would you like
 

4297
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,250
hey I I see your home would you like
some dinner right like let's go get some

4298
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:08,260
some dinner right like let's go get some
 

4299
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,540
some dinner right like let's go get some
food because that's usually what we do

4300
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:09,550
food because that's usually what we do
 

4301
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:11,460
food because that's usually what we do
this time of day right and the context

4302
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:11,470
this time of day right and the context
 

4303
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:13,980
this time of day right and the context
of actually the act of programming DCI

4304
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:13,990
of actually the act of programming DCI
 

4305
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:16,020
of actually the act of programming DCI
des improving and making the life of

4306
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:16,030
des improving and making the life of
 

4307
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:18,390
des improving and making the life of
programming is better I do think that is

4308
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:18,400
programming is better I do think that is
 

4309
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,740
programming is better I do think that is
possible cuz things a lot of repetition

4310
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:19,750
possible cuz things a lot of repetition
 

4311
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:22,170
possible cuz things a lot of repetition
in programming right oh you know Clippy

4312
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:22,180
in programming right oh you know Clippy
 

4313
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:23,790
in programming right oh you know Clippy
would be the bad example of oh I see it

4314
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:23,800
would be the bad example of oh I see it
 

4315
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,260
would be the bad example of oh I see it
looks like you're writing a for loop

4316
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:25,270
looks like you're writing a for loop
 

4317
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:27,780
looks like you're writing a for loop
um but there are patterns in code right

4318
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:27,790
um but there are patterns in code right
 

4319
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:29,760
um but there are patterns in code right
like in and actually libraries are kind

4320
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:29,770
like in and actually libraries are kind
 

4321
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:32,010
like in and actually libraries are kind
of like that right like rather than go

4322
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:32,020
of like that right like rather than go
 

4323
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:35,010
of like that right like rather than go
you know code up your own HTTP request

4325
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:36,660
you know code up your own HTTP request
library it's like what you'd use one of

01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:36,670
library it's like what you'd use one of
 

4327
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:38,670
library it's like what you'd use one of
the existing ones that we have that's

4328
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:38,680
the existing ones that we have that's
 

4329
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,650
the existing ones that we have that's
already troubleshot right it's not a I

4330
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:40,660
already troubleshot right it's not a I
 

4331
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:43,740
already troubleshot right it's not a I
per se it's just you know building

4332
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:43,750
per se it's just you know building
 

4333
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,540
per se it's just you know building
better Lego bricks bigger Lego bricks

4334
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:45,550
better Lego bricks bigger Lego bricks
 

4335
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:47,880
better Lego bricks bigger Lego bricks
that have more functionality in them so

4336
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:47,890
that have more functionality in them so
 

4337
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,079
that have more functionality in them so
people don't have to worry about the

4338
01:08:49,079 --> 01:08:49,089
people don't have to worry about the
 

4339
01:08:49,089 --> 01:08:50,500
people don't have to worry about the
low-level stuff as much anymore

4340
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:50,510
low-level stuff as much anymore
 

4341
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:52,360
low-level stuff as much anymore
like WordPress for example to me is like

4342
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:52,370
like WordPress for example to me is like
 

4343
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:53,770
like WordPress for example to me is like
a tool for someone who is in a

4344
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:53,780
a tool for someone who is in a
 

4345
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:56,290
a tool for someone who is in a
programmer to do something I mean you

4346
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:56,300
programmer to do something I mean you
 

4347
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,760
programmer to do something I mean you
can turn WordPress into anything it's

4348
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:57,770
can turn WordPress into anything it's
 

4349
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:58,960
can turn WordPress into anything it's
kind of crazy actually through perla

4350
01:08:58,960 --> 01:08:58,970
kind of crazy actually through perla
 

4351
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:00,250
kind of crazy actually through perla
plugins right and that's not programming

4352
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:00,260
plugins right and that's not programming
 

4353
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,970
plugins right and that's not programming
per se it's just Lego bricks stacking

4354
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:02,980
per se it's just Lego bricks stacking
 

4355
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:05,020
per se it's just Lego bricks stacking
WordPress elements right a little bit of

4356
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:05,030
WordPress elements right a little bit of
 

4357
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:07,390
WordPress elements right a little bit of
configuration glue so I would say maybe

4358
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:07,400
configuration glue so I would say maybe
 

4359
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,160
configuration glue so I would say maybe
in a broader sense what I'm seeing like

4360
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:09,170
in a broader sense what I'm seeing like
 

4361
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:12,400
in a broader sense what I'm seeing like
they'll be more gluing and less like

4362
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:12,410
they'll be more gluing and less like
 

4363
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:14,680
they'll be more gluing and less like
actual programming and that's a good

4364
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:14,690
actual programming and that's a good
 

4365
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:16,480
actual programming and that's a good
thing right because most of the stuff

4366
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:16,490
thing right because most of the stuff
 

4367
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:17,530
thing right because most of the stuff
you need is kind of out there already

4368
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:17,540
you need is kind of out there already
 

4369
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:21,580
you need is kind of out there already
you said 1970 is Unix do you see PHP and

4370
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:21,590
you said 1970 is Unix do you see PHP and
 

4371
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:30,310
you said 1970 is Unix do you see PHP and
these kind of old remnants of the early

4372
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:30,320
these kind of old remnants of the early
 

4373
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,770
these kind of old remnants of the early
birth of programming remaining with us

4374
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:32,780
birth of programming remaining with us
 

4375
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,810
birth of programming remaining with us
for a long time like you said Unix in

4376
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:34,820
for a long time like you said Unix in
 

4377
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,440
for a long time like you said Unix in
itself

4378
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:35,450
itself
 

4379
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:37,840

do you see ultimately you know this

4380
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:37,850
do you see ultimately you know this
 

4381
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:42,300
do you see ultimately you know this
stuff just being there out of momentum I

4382
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:42,310
stuff just being there out of momentum I
 

4383
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:45,250
stuff just being there out of momentum I
kind of do I mean I was a big believer

4384
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:45,260
kind of do I mean I was a big believer
 

4385
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,960
kind of do I mean I was a big believer
in Windows early on and I was a big you

4386
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:46,970
in Windows early on and I was a big you
 

4387
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:48,130
in Windows early on and I was a big you
know I was like a UNIX what a waste of

4388
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:48,140
know I was like a UNIX what a waste of
 

4389
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,630
know I was like a UNIX what a waste of
time but over time I've completely

4390
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:49,640
time but over time I've completely
 

4391
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,500
time but over time I've completely
flipped on that where I was like okay

4392
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:50,510
flipped on that where I was like okay
 

4393
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:52,240
flipped on that where I was like okay
the UNIX guys were right and pretty much

4394
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:52,250
the UNIX guys were right and pretty much
 

4395
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:53,680
the UNIX guys were right and pretty much
Microsoft and windows were kind of wrong

4396
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:53,690
Microsoft and windows were kind of wrong
 

4397
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,020
Microsoft and windows were kind of wrong
at least on the server side not on the

4398
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:56,030
at least on the server side not on the
 

4399
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:57,550
at least on the server side not on the
desktop right you need a GUI you know

4400
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:57,560
desktop right you need a GUI you know
 

4401
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,140
desktop right you need a GUI you know
what stuff and yeah the two philosophies

4402
01:09:59,140 --> 01:09:59,150
what stuff and yeah the two philosophies
 

4403
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:01,270
what stuff and yeah the two philosophies
like Apple built on UNIX effectively

4404
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:01,280
like Apple built on UNIX effectively
 

4405
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,210
like Apple built on UNIX effectively
Darwin and on the desktop is a slightly

4406
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:04,220
Darwin and on the desktop is a slightly
 

4407
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,470
Darwin and on the desktop is a slightly
restore even on the server side where

4408

you're going to be programming now it's

4410
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:07,250
you're going to be programming now it's
 

4411
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,350
you're going to be programming now it's
question where the program is gonna be

4412
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:08,360
question where the program is gonna be
 

4413
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,460
question where the program is gonna be
there's gonna be a lot more like

4414
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:09,470
there's gonna be a lot more like
 

4415
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:10,900
there's gonna be a lot more like
client-side programming because

4416
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:10,910
client-side programming because
 

4417
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:12,730
client-side programming because
technically discourse is client-side

4418
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:12,740
technically discourse is client-side
 

4419
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,560
technically discourse is client-side
programming the way you get discourse we

4420
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:14,570
programming the way you get discourse we
 

4421
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:16,420
programming the way you get discourse we
deliver a big ball of JavaScript which

4422
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:16,430
deliver a big ball of JavaScript which
 

4423
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:18,970
deliver a big ball of JavaScript which
is then execute locally so we're really

4424
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:18,980
is then execute locally so we're really
 

4425
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,470
is then execute locally so we're really
using a lot more local computing power

4426
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:20,480
using a lot more local computing power
 

4427
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,330
using a lot more local computing power
will still retrieve the data obviously

4428
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:22,340
will still retrieve the data obviously
 

4429
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,530
will still retrieve the data obviously
we have to display the posts on the

4430
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:23,540
we have to display the posts on the
 

4431
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:24,880
we have to display the posts on the
screen and so forth but in terms of like

4432
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:24,890
screen and so forth but in terms of like
 

4433
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:26,800
screen and so forth but in terms of like
sorting and a lot of the basic stuff

4434
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:26,810
sorting and a lot of the basic stuff
 

4435
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:29,950
sorting and a lot of the basic stuff
we're using the host processor but to

4436
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:29,960
we're using the host processor but to
 

4437
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,330
we're using the host processor but to
the extent that a lot of programming is

4438
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:31,340
the extent that a lot of programming is
 

4439
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:33,370
the extent that a lot of programming is
still gonna be server-side I would say

4440
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:33,380
still gonna be server-side I would say
 

4441
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,020
still gonna be server-side I would say
yeah the UNIX philosophy definitely one

4442
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:35,030
yeah the UNIX philosophy definitely one
 

4443
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:37,870
yeah the UNIX philosophy definitely one
and they'll be different veneers over

4444
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:37,880
and they'll be different veneers over
 

4445
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,760
and they'll be different veneers over
the UNIX but it's still if you if you

4446
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:39,770
the UNIX but it's still if you if you
 

4447
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:41,020
the UNIX but it's still if you if you
peel away one or two layers it's gonna

4448
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:41,030
peel away one or two layers it's gonna
 

4449
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:43,780
peel away one or two layers it's gonna
be UNIX safe for a long I think UNIX one

4450
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:43,790
be UNIX safe for a long I think UNIX one
 

4451
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:46,510
be UNIX safe for a long I think UNIX one
I mean so definitively it's interesting

4452
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:46,520
I mean so definitively it's interesting
 

4453
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,010
I mean so definitively it's interesting
to hear you say that because you've done

4454
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:48,020
to hear you say that because you've done
 

4455
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:49,720
to hear you say that because you've done
so much excellent work on the Microsoft

4456
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:49,730
so much excellent work on the Microsoft
 

4457
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:51,700
so much excellent work on the Microsoft
and aside in terms of back-end

4458
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:51,710
and aside in terms of back-end
 

4459
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:54,790
and aside in terms of back-end
development cool so what's the future

4460
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:54,800
development cool so what's the future
 

4461
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,840
development cool so what's the future
hold for Jeff Atwood amid the discourse

4462
01:10:58,840 --> 01:10:58,850
hold for Jeff Atwood amid the discourse
 

4463
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:02,290
hold for Jeff Atwood amid the discourse
continuing the discourse in trying to

4464
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:02,300
continuing the discourse in trying to
 

4465
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,120
continuing the discourse in trying to
improve conversation on the web

4466
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:04,130
improve conversation on the web
 

4467
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:05,740
improve conversation on the web
this force is whatever be it is a and

4468
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:05,750
this force is whatever be it is a and

originally I call it a five-year project

4470
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:06,860
originally I call it a five-year project
 

4471
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,050
originally I call it a five-year project
then really quickly revised that to a

4472
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:08,060
then really quickly revised that to a
 

4473
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,410
then really quickly revised that to a
ten-year project so where we started in

4474
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:10,420
ten-year project so where we started in
 

4475
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,820
ten-year project so where we started in
early to that 2013 that's we launched

4476
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:12,830
early to that 2013 that's we launched
 

4477
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:14,979
early to that 2013 that's we launched
the first version so we're still you

4478
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:14,989
the first version so we're still you
 

4479
01:11:14,989 --> 01:11:16,660
the first version so we're still you
know five years in this is the part

I helped the owner one things I I got
them switched to discourse obviously

4794
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:32,720
them switched to discourse obviously
 

4795
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,300
them switched to discourse obviously
paid them to switch to discourse because

4796
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:34,310
paid them to switch to discourse because
 

4797
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:35,380
paid them to switch to discourse because
I was like look you guys got a switch I

4798
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:35,390
I was like look you guys got a switch I
 

4799
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:36,400
I was like look you guys got a switch I
can't come here anymore all this

4800
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:36,410
can't come here anymore all this
 

4801
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:38,890
can't come here anymore all this
terrible in software but I was like a

terrible in software but I was like a
 

4803
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,600

4887
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:00,340
also kind of a fetish shot it was like
wow I care enough about programming that

4888
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:00,350
wow I care enough about programming that
 

4889
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:02,080
wow I care enough about programming that
I care about the tool the primary tool

4890
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:02,090
I care about the tool the primary tool
 

4891
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:03,400
I care about the tool the primary tool
that I use committing to computer make

4892
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:03,410
that I use committing to computer make
 

4893
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:05,320

programmer being able to type really

4910
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:18,230
programmer being able to type really
 

4911
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:21,100
programmer being able to type really
fast right like this is true right so a

4912
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:21,110
fast right like this is true right so a
 

4913
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:23,050

4917
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:27,070
fast enough to get your ideas out of
your head into the codebase so just

4918
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:27,080
your head into the codebase so just
 

4919
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,419
your head into the codebase so just
practicing your typing can make you a

4920

practicing your typing can make you a
 

4921
01:18:28,429 --> 01:18:30,760
practicing your typing can make you a
better programmer it is also something

4922
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:30,770
better programmer it is also something
 

4923

it's time so there's a tactile feel that
 

4931
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:46,540
it's time so there's a tactile feel that
ultimately feeds the passion makes you

4932

and it's funny because artisanal
 

4937
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:51,370
and it's funny because artisanal
