[Introduction]

00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,910
DAVID MALAN: This is CS50,
Harvard University's introduction

3
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,310
to the intellectual
enterprises of computer science

4
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,810
and the art of programming.

5
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,480
My name is David Malan,
and if you are among those

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,300
in the room who are thinking, why
am I in a class of computer science,

7
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,750
realize that I too felt
that exact same way.

8
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,460
In fact, my freshman
year, I didn't quite

9
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,820
get up the nerve to take this class
or computer science more generally,

10
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,530
and that was largely because
I was intimidated by it.

11
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,680
I was a little nervous.

12
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,590
It felt well out of my comfort zone.

13
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,860
And I really didn't know at the end
of the day what it actually was.

14
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,280
But realize if you, too, are
feeling a little bit of that,

15
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,140
or even if you're among
those more comfortable who

16
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,270
have dabbled in computer
science or programming,

17
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,180
realize that there's so many blanks
that we can fill in along the way

18
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,510
so that ultimately, at the
end of the semester, everyone

19
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,280
will feel themselves on the same page.

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,870
And until then, rest assured that 68%
of the people sitting to your left

21
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,940
and to your right and
behind and in front

22
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,230
have never taken a CS course
before, which may very well be

23
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,000
the demographic into which you fit.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,330
But realize, too, that with
such an amazing support

25
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,820
structure with so many office hours
and sections and materials and beyond,

26
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,120
realize that what's ultimately
important in this course

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,180
is not so much where you end
up relative to your classmates

28
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,530
in week 10, our final week, but
where you end up relative to yourself

29
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,400
in week zero.

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,050
And indeed, that is where we now are.

31
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,810
And as it turns out, computer
scientists start counting at zero.

32
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,690
And so over the next 11
weeks, we will take you

33
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,060
from being among those
less comfortable or perhaps

34
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,120
somewhere in between
less comfortable and more

35
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,510
to feeling much more comfortable
and confident and capable than that.

36
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,990
But to get there, we need to understand
what computer science really is.

37
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,870
And this was something I didn't
understand until I set foot in a room

38
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,530
like this.

39
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,160
And I dare say we can distill computer
science into just this picture.

40
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,290
Computer science is
about problem solving.

41
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,440
And I know that high school
courses typically do kind of paint

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,270
a misleading picture
that it's only about

43
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,910
and it's entirely about programming
and people with their heads

44
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,270
down in the computer lab working
fairly anti-socially on code,

45
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,270
but the reality is it's all about
solving problems, and very often,

46
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,140
solving problems collaboratively
either in person or by leveraging code,

47
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,240
programs that others
have written in the past.

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,980
And what does it mean
to solve a problem?

49
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,440
Well, you need inputs.

50
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,280
So there's a problem
you're trying to solve.

51
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,150
That is the input.

52
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,990
And you want output.

53
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,800
You want the solution to that problem.

54
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,830
And the sort of secret
sauce of computer science

55
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,140
is going to be everything
in this proverbial black box

56
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,440
in the middle over the
next several weeks,

57
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,090
where you begin to understand
exactly what you can do with that.

58
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,050
But in order to start solving
problems, we kind of just

59
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,290
need to decide as a group how we're
going to represent these problems

60
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,780
and what might a problem be.

61
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,350
Well, in this room, there's
a whole bunch of people.

62
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,650
If we wanted to take attendance or
count the number of people in this room,

63
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,040
I might need to start keeping
track of how many people I see.

64
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,700
But how do I represent the
number of people I see?

65
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,070
Well, I can do it sort of old school
and I can just take out a piece of chalk

66
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,320
or whatnot and say, all right.

67
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,260
I see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

68
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,220
I can do little stylistic
conventions like that

69
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,290
to save space and remind myself.

70
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,840
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and so forth.

71
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,860
Or I can, of course, just
do that on my own hand.

72
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,730
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so forth.

73
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,350
But obviously, how high can
I count on just one hand?

74
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,110
So 5 you would think, but that's
just because we haven't really

75
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,760
thought hard enough about this problem.

76
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,850
It turns out that with just these five
fingers, let alone these five more,

77
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,360
I can actually count rather higher
because after all, the system

78
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,310
I'm using of hashmarks
on the board or just

79
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,550
now with my fingers is just kind of
keeping my fingers down and putting

80
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,190
them up to represent ones, really.

81
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,160
But what if I actually took into
account the order of my fingers

82
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,860
and sort of permuted them, so to speak,
so that it's really patterns of fingers

83
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,860
that represent the number
of people in the room,

84
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,660
and not just the mere presence
of a finger going up or down.

85
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,480
In other words, this can remain zero.

86
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,130
This could still be one.

87
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,250
But what if two is not
just this, the obvious?

88
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,140
But what if it's just this?

89
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,660
So raising just one, my second finger.

90
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,180
What if, then, three is this?

91
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,420
So we have 0, 1, 2, 3.

92
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,150
That's going to lead us to
four somewhat offensively.

93
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,140
But if we begin to jump
ahead to five, I might now

94
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,790
permute this finger and this finger up.

95
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,120
And if I want to now represent
six, I could do this.

96
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,910
And now seven.

97
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,870
In other words, I've expressed so
many more patterns on my hand already

98
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,910
and if we keep doing this,
I think I can actually

99
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,740
represent painfully perhaps like 32
different patterns, and therefore

100
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,380
32 different people, on my hands alone.

101
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,690
Or 31 people if I
start counting at zero.

102
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,750
So what is that--
what's the relationship

103
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,960
and how did we even get here?

104
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,810
Well, it turns out that
computers are kind of simplistic,

105
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,400
much like our hands here.

106
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,940
At the end of the day, your
computer is plugged into the wall

107
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,980
or it's got a battery, so it either
has or it does not have electricity.

108
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,140
At the end of the day, that
is the physical resource

109
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,030
that drives these things and our
phones and all of technology today.

110
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,650
So if there is either electricity
or not, that kind of maps nicely

111
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,810
to no finger or yes finger.

112
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,350
And indeed, computers, as you probably
know, only speak what language?

113
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,980
What alphabet, so to speak?

114
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,480
Yeah.

115
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:41,990
Binary.

116
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,890
Bi meaning two.

117
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,160
And indeed, that refers to the
fact that in binary in computers,

118
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,050
you only have two digits--

119
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,200
zero and one.

120
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,440
We humans, of course, have
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

121
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,570
and then we can combine
those to count even higher.

122
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,950
But computers only have
0, 1, and then that's it.

123
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,910
Because at the end of
the day, there's actually

124
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,290
a direct mapping between power being off
and it being a zero or power being on

125
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,770
and it being one, or some electrons
or whatever flowing from your battery

126
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,980
or from the wall.

127
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,240
So this is why computers
tend to speak only binary,

128
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,760
because at the end of the day,
it just maps really cleanly

129
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,360
to what it is that's powering
them in the first place.

130
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,920
But how is this actually useful?

131
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,280
If computers only have zeros and
ones, how can they do anything useful?

132
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,030
Well, think about our human world, where
you might have this pattern of symbols.

133
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,050
This is decimal, dec meaning 10
because you have 0 through 9.

134
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,270
And this is, of course, 123.

135
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,960
But why?

136
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,330
If you haven't thought about
this in quite some time,

137
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,200
this is really just a pattern of three
symbols, one and two and three shapes,

138
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,520
or glyphs, on the screen.

139
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,850
But we humans, ever since grade
school, have started ascribing meaning

140
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,310
to each of these numbers, right?

141
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,710
If you think back, this is the ones
column, this is the tens column,

142
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,300
this is the hundreds column, and
so forth, and we could keep going.

143
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,450
And so why does this pattern--
one, two, three-- mean 123?

144
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,620
Well, it's because all
of us sort of intuitively

145
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,860
nowadays are just quickly in our
head doing 100 times 1 plus 10 times

146
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:11,430
2 plus 1 times 3, which of course
gives us 100 plus 20 plus three,

147
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,210
and then the number we
know mathematically as 123.

148
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,510
But we're all doing this so quickly, you
don't really think about this anymore.

149
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,040
Well, computers work
fundamentally the same way.

150
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,410
They don't have as many digits--

151
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,030
0 through 9-- as we do.

152
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,080
They only have zeros and ones.

153
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,290
And so if they were to
store values, you're

154
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,790
only going to see zeros
and ones on the screen,

155
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,950
but those zeros and ones
just mean different things.

156
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,530
Instead of having a ones
place, tens, a hundreds,

157
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,210
they're going to have a ones
place, a twos place, a fours place,

158
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,410
and then eights and 16 and beyond.

159
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,060
Now, why?

160
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,250
Well, one and 10 and 100, turns
out those are powers of 10.

161
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,580
10 to the 0 is technically 1.

162
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,340
10 to the 1 is just 10.

163
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,750
10 to the 2 is 100.

164
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,140
And that's why you have ones, tens
hundreds, thousands, and so forth.

165
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,720
Computers are apparently
using powers of 2.

166
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,440
Not surprising.

167
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,580
Binary-- two.

168
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,410
So if you only have ones, twos,
and fours as your placeholders,

169
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,190
if a computer were
storing these digits--

170
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,990
0, 0, 0-- that computer is presumably
storing what number so far as we

171
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,680
humans understand it?

172
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,560
Well, that's how a
computer would store zero.

173
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,800
If a computer is storing
literally 0, 0, 0, just

174
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,590
like in our human world, that
also is 0, but that's technically

175
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,940
because it's 4 times 0 plus 2 times 0
plus 1 times zero, which is obviously

176
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,600
zero.

177
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,870
Meanwhile, if a computer is
actually storing not just,

178
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,790
say, 0, 0, 0, but instead is
storing this value in binary,

179
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,190
what does that map to in decimal?

180
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,120
So that's one.

181
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,640
And now, why, if we change this 0 and
1 to this value here, is this two?

182
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,030
Well, mathematically, for
the exact same reasons.

183
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,290
And so earlier, I had five fingers, but
if you consider just my first three,

184
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,310
when I did this holding up one
finger, I was representing two.

185
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,550
And if I want to represent three,
recall that I put up the second finger.

186
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,760
And so the reason that
could nicely represent three

187
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,110
is because all I was doing with my
human hand was counting in binary.

188
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,160
And I could keep counting
more and more and more.

189
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,110
And so if I have five fingers or
five bits, bit meaning binary digits,

190
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,200
I could count up, it turns
out, if we do the math,

191
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,200
as high as 31 by starting to zero.

192
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,530
It's going to be hard to
physically do that, but we could.

193
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,280
So why is this useful?

194
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,150
At the end of the day,
a computer, therefore,

195
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,750
can represent any number of values from
0 to 1 to 2 to 3 to some number much,

196
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,910
much, much higher than that.

197
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,740
All it needs is enough
bits, enough zeros and ones.

198
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,940
Well, what are those bits?

199
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,050
Well, all of us have these days in our
phones sources of light, for instance.

200
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,050
So I could actually say that
this physical device right now--

201
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,490
might be a little hard to tell--

202
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,440
it does have a flashlight and it's
technically off at the moment.

203
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,200
But if I turn this flashlight on,
thereby using some of the electricity,

204
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,860
now, I'm storing a one.

205
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,940
And so the phone is on.

206
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,870
Now, it's off.

207
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,620
Now, it's on.

208
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,600
And if I see--

209
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,270
can I borrow someone's phone real quick?

210
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,140
May I?

211
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,640
OK.

212
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,700
And flashlight.

213
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,560
How do I turn on the flashlight?

214
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,060
Oh.

215
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,560
Shake it.

216
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,560
That's OK.

217
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,060
OK.

218
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,340
Thank you.

219
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:09,840
Oh.

220
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,260
Thank you.

221
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,710
OK.

222
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,410
So this is great.

223
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,560
Now, I can count higher.

224
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,790
Now, this represents the number what if
I have two light bulbs or two switches

225
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,180
on at the moment?

226
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:19,680
Yeah.

227
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,170
Three.

228
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,050
Because I have a one,
I have a one, and I

229
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,150
have two, which of course is
going to end up equaling three.

230
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,090
And if I pick up a third phone
somehow, I could count even higher.

231
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,570
Technically, if I had
three light bulbs on--

232
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,350
one, one, one-- what
would that value be?

233
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:32,850
Seven.

234
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,010
Because it's a four plus a
two plus a one, and so forth.

235
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,020
Thank you so much for the spontaneity.

236
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,780
So why does this not lead
to limitations for us?

237
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,120
I can count in decimal
as high as I want.

238
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,540
I can now count in binary as high as
I want, so long as I have enough bits.

239
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,310
But how do I actually
represent other information?

240
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,250
Well, if I want to represent something
like a letter, how do I get there?

241
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,540
If computers only have electricity
in them and they use binary to count,

242
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,300
and yet somehow they're much more
useful than just doing math--

243
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,050
they can have text messages and e-mails
and websites and videos and more--

244
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,140
how do we get from zeros
and ones to letters?

245
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,400
Well, we-- yeah.

246
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,620
Sorry.

247
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,140
A little louder.

248
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,650
Yeah.

249
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,630
We just need to kind of
relate the numbers to letters.

250
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,510
In other words, all the people in this
room just need to decide at some point

251
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,410
that, you know what?

252
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,200
If we want to represent something
like the capital letter A,

253
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,180
we just need to decide
on a pattern of bits,

254
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,730
a pattern of fingers,
that's going to represent A.

255
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,670
And it turns out humans
years ago just unilaterally

256
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,840
decided 65 shall be the decimal number
that represents capital letter A.

257
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,700
And you might guess capital B is
represented by what decimal number?

258
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,420
66.

259
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,500
And then C is 67 and so forth.

260
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,630
And there's a mapping of like
128 or even 256 possible values

261
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,880
for all the keys you might
see on a typical keyboard

262
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,680
in order to represent letters.

263
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,260
Now, how does a computer distinguish,
though, numbers from letters?

264
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,680
Well, just depends on the context.

265
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,880
If you're using like a
calculator program on your Mac

266
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,600
or PC or iPhone or Android,
well, the computer, the device,

267
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,050
is just going to know contextually,
let me interpret this pattern of zeros

268
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,330
and ones as actual numbers to do math.

269
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,880
But if you're using the SMS app
or the messages app on your phone,

270
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,060
you're going to actually
be in the context of text,

271
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,380
and so your phone is going to interpret
that same pattern of zeros and ones,

272
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,780
or light bulbs being off, or, at
the end of the day, transistors,

273
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,450
tiny pieces of hardware and
computers that are either on or off--

274
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,470
it's going to interpret those patterns
as just representing a letter.

275
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,220
If you're in the context of a text
messaging application or Microsoft Word

276
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,180
or Google Docs or the like, it
completely depends on context.

277
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,780
The system we humans came up with just
called ASCII, American Standard Code

278
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,100
for Information Interchange.

279
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,760
The name isn't interesting, but the
fact that we all agreed years ago

280
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,210
that 65 is A and so forth
is what's important.

281
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,800
And so for instance, if we
look at this mapping here

282
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,340
of just the first few
letters, what does this mean?

283
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,920
If I were to now get a text message
and I had the ability somehow

284
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,190
to look underneath the hood, so to
speak, at the pattern of zeros and ones

285
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,890
that someone had just
texted me, and that pattern,

286
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:12,230
if I convert it to decimal, technically
said, let's say, 72 and 73--

287
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,970
so I get a whole bunch
of zeros and ones.

288
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,480
I do some math and I realize,
OK, I just received 72 and 73,

289
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,690
but this is texting, and so it's not
just numbers my friend is sending me.

290
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,690
It's a message.

291
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:27,840
What message did my friend likely send
me if he or she sent 72 and then 73?

292
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,370
Yeah.

293
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:28,860
Hi.

294
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,280
H-I. Because if you skim
ahead at the right there,

295
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,720
that just happens to be in ASCII the
mapping between 72 and 73, H and I.

296
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,240
If technically, the message
had a third byte, if you will.

297
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,090
A byte, if you've ever
wondered, is just eight bits.

298
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,260
It's convenient to talk not
in terms of single bits,

299
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,440
where you can't count very high,
but with a byte, or eight bits,

300
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,700
you can count higher.

301
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,600
And so it turns out if I received a
third byte, another sequence of eight

302
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,520
zeros and ones together--

303
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,150
33.

304
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,490
How would we know what
this message now is?

305
00:13:59,490 --> 00:13:59,990
Yeah.

306
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,640
So it turns out you
would not know this other

307
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,430
than by guessing or Googling or
just coming in with this knowledge.

308
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,360
This is now "HI!"

309
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,020
with an exclamation point because 33
just so happens, if you look it up,

310
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,180
to map to an exclamation point, as well.

311
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,360
Now, if we actually looked
at the binary of this,

312
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,610
you would actually see this
pattern of zeros and ones.

313
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,920
This is how you represent 72 in binary.

314
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,690
This is you represent 73.

315
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,820
And this is how you represent 33.

316
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,810
And notice I've only used one,
two, three, four, five, six bits,

317
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,200
even though I technically tend
to receive things in units of 8,

318
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,220
units of bytes.

319
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:37,770
But why did I not bother writing
another 00 here and another 0 here?

320
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,660
Does it matter when you
write these things out?

321
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,160
No.

322
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,670
Not really.

323
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,010
Like in English, in our human world,
if you were to write one, two, three,

324
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,280
that's 123.

325
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,850
If you were to write 0,
1, 2, 3, that's still 123.

326
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,670
So even though we tend to
get them in clusters of 8,

327
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,660
we don't necessarily need to write
those when just talking about them.

328
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,540
So what have we done?

329
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,160
Well, let me introduce a fancier
word now known as abstraction.

330
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,480
Abstraction is just a term generally
used in computer science and we'll soon

331
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,530
see in programming for taking some
low level-- like literally low level--

332
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,700
implementation details, like
minutiae even, and understanding them

333
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,450
at some point, but then deciding this
is not a useful level conceptually

334
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,750
to think about problems.

335
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,280
I really don't want to solve problems in
this world of thinking in 0's and 1's.

336
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,910
I'd much rather think about things
minimally in decimal, or better yet,

337
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,640
in the context of letters if I'm
actually receiving text, or even

338
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,110
some other representation.

339
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,040
So abstraction is about taking
fairly low level details

340
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,980
and just simplifying them so that we
can have a more useful conversation

341
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,300
and never again worry about where
the electricity is coming from.

342
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,730
We can just stipulate my computer
can represent zeros and ones.

343
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,230
Therefore, it can represent numbers.

344
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,010
Therefore, it can also
represent ASCII or letters.

345
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,850
And we can kind of move on and start
solving more interesting problems.

346
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:56,700
But it would seem that we can't solve
all problems because on my keyboard

347
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,300
here, this American keyboard here,
there's a whole bunch of symbols,

348
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,810
like a 100 or 200 maybe in total if we
actually hit shift and option and all

349
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,560
of that.

350
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,170
But what you don't see are
some pretty common characters.

351
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,010
Especially in a very
international audience,

352
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,490
what can I apparently not
even type on this keyboard?

353
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,410
What kinds of symbols?

354
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,000
Yeah.

355
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,190
Anything with an accent.

356
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,240
If you have accents over
vowels or other letters.

357
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,740
What else?

358
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,810
I'm sorry.

359
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,560
Umlauts or other
characters above letters.

360
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,060
Yeah.

361
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,170
Like pound symbol?

362
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:26,670
Oh.

363
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,710
Like the UK pound symbol.

364
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,210
Sure.

365
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,340
And other countries, too.

366
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,790
Any number of Asian languages.

367
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,410
There's so many symbols that are
not depicted on this keyboard,

368
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,630
and yet somehow, all of us with
international keyboards or phones

369
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,410
can surely express themselves.

370
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,180
But that's because phones and computers
these days don't just use ASCII.

371
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,030
ASCII literally used
just eight bits total.

372
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,290
Technically seven, but then,
ultimately, really eight.

373
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,380
And with eight bits, if
you actually do the math--

374
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,750
if you have eight bits
or eight fingers, you

375
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,130
can only permute them in 256
total possible ways, which

376
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:01,620
is to say that you can only represent
256 characters using ASCII with numbers

377
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,930
underneath the hood, and
that's not enough to represent

378
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,220
so many different symbols
like those enumerated here.

379
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,850
You can't represent any of the
accents that you can nonetheless

380
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,400
type on your Macs and
PCs and you certainly

381
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,740
can't type these things,
which are very much in vogue.

382
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,520
Which even though they're pictures,
they're actually just characters.

383
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,020
Because it turns out some years ago, the
world decided eight bits is not enough.

384
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,020
Let's start using something called
Unicode, where you actually use

385
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,200
one or two or three or even four bytes.

386
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,450
So eight bits or 16 bits, 24 bits, or
even 32 bits to represent characters.

387
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,940
And now, we have the ability
to represent thousands or even

388
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,440
millions of characters.

389
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,540
And frankly, daresay, the result
of that huge amount of availability

390
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,340
is partly why there are so many
of these things these days.

391
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,540
And they just keep making more because
there's just so many different numbers

392
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,320
available to us.

393
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,950
So Unicode is often a specific
version of it called UTF-8,

394
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,210
which we'll see before long.

395
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,060
But let me ask this question here.

396
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:01,710
This is a crying face with
joy, I think this is called.

397
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,830
So it turns out,
according to Apple or iOS,

398
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,420
this is the most popular emoji
that at least iPhone people

399
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,710
are sending to each other.

400
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,710
So when you're receiving this, though,
if we can really take the fun out

401
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,860
of this, what pattern of bits are you
actually receiving from your friend?

402
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,580
He or she is clearly trying
to express some emotion,

403
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:24,030
but really, what your friend is sending
you-- the decimal number 128,514.

404
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,670
Or really, if you looked at
the zeros and ones coming

405
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,220
to you over the internet
or airwaves, you're

406
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,540
getting this pattern of zeros and
ones, which is hardly joyful or hardly

407
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,060
descriptive, but all
your phone or computer

408
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,040
are doing is seeing
this pattern of bits,

409
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,530
looking it up in like a little
cheat sheet, and saying, oh.

410
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,220
Whenever I see this pattern of bits
in the context of text like texting,

411
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,490
I should actually display
it as that picture.

412
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,550
Now, that picture has a lot
of yellow and other colors

413
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,050
in it, but how do we even get there?

414
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,410
Well, it turns out that this
same pattern of numbers--

415
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,040
72, 73, 33-- which just to be
sure, a moment ago, meant what?

416
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,540
Hi.

417
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,650
In the context of a textual program like
Microsoft Word, Google Docs, texting,

418
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,940
this means hi.

419
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,900
But what if you saw this
same pattern of bytes--

420
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,820
and again, we could
draw the zeros and ones,

421
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,820
but it's not interesting
anymore, so we're going

422
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,540
to abstract away at the decimal level.

423
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,450
If you got this same
pattern of zeros and ones

424
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,060
or numbers in the context of
like Photoshop or a browser

425
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,900
or some kind of photo program,
well, it might make more sense

426
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,660
to interpret it not as text, but
as imagery, some kind of colors.

427
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,120
Well, it turns out there's this
other system in the world--

428
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,820
you might have seen
this acronym before--

429
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,560
called RGB-- red, green, blue.

430
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,980
And this is just a way of
humans having standardized years

431
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,940
ago that you know what?

432
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,910
If we want to represent a dot on
someone's screen, otherwise known

433
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,950
as a pixel a tiny little
square on the screen

434
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,880
of your phone, your laptop,
or even TV these days,

435
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,900
we're going to use three bytes--

436
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,010
one byte to specify how much red
should be in that specific pixel,

437
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,940
one more byte to specify how much green
should be combined with red to form

438
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,400
that pixel, and then
one more byte, a third,

439
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,550
to represent how much blue to
combine with those other two colors

440
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,620
to make a new color all together.

441
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,230
So it's kind of like combining
paints, except in this case,

442
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,810
it's more really waves of light in
order to get a specific color using just

443
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,510
red, green, and blue as your palette.

444
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:20,180
And so if we were to see this
red, green, blue pattern and say,

445
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,770
you know what?

446
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,780
Give me 72 red, 73 of
green, and 33 of blue.

447
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,490
If the total possible range that I
alluded to earlier is like 0 to 256,

448
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,770
or technically 0 to 255 if you start
counting in computer science from zero,

449
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,590
this is like a medium amount
of red, medium amount of green,

450
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,140
and just a little bit of blue,
if the range goes from 0 to 255.

451
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,100
So if you combine these
three things together

452
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,790
and you want to know
what color you get--

453
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,770
yeah.

454
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,840
So it's kind of a light
yellow that looks like this.

455
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,360
So if a computer is storing a
single dot on the screen that

456
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,720
happens to be in yellow, what
the computer's actually storing

457
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,640
is not this dot physically,
but a pattern of three

458
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,600
bytes-- how much red, how much green,
how much blue should the computer

459
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,560
display at this particular point.

460
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,230
So if we look at this crying face of
joy and we kind of enhance or zoom in

461
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,320
on it here, you can actually see
it start to pixelate, so to speak,

462
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,660
where you start to see the dots.

463
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,970
If I punch in a little
more, now you can really

464
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,170
start to see the dots on the screen.

465
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,230
And if I go an even
further, you can actually

466
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,250
see the tiny little squares that
compose this image, most of which

467
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,430
at the zoom level are yellow,
but a bunch of which are black,

468
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:33,310
a bunch of which are light
black or dark yellow.

469
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,790
And that's what composes
this image ultimately.

470
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,990
So this is to say if you count up
all of the pixels on the screen

471
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,260
and then multiply it by one,
two, three bytes, that's

472
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,950
how many bytes or kilobytes or
megabytes, if you've heard those terms,

473
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,670
are going to be stored on your
computer just to represent an image.

474
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,130
So we've gone from electricity to down
here, so to speak, to zeros and ones,

475
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,050
to decimal, now to colors.

476
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,300
Well, with colors, you can get images.

477
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,540
What comes after images?

478
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,280
Well, we've all watched videos or
movies certainly digitally these days.

479
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,530
Well, what is a movie or a video file?

480
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,220
How might that be implemented?

481
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,380
Say it a little louder.

482
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:13,880
Yeah.

483
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,120
It's a collection of images.

484
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,910
If you've ever heard
of frames per second--

485
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,750
like movies tend to be 24 frames
per second or 30 frames per second--

486
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,510
that just means that a
typical movie, every second

487
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,810
is showing you 24 or
30 images per second

488
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,240
and they're just flying by
so quickly that you actually

489
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,970
don't notice you're just watching
a sequence of static images.

490
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,270
It's like as a kid, if you ever had one
of those paper flip books where there's

491
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,060
tons of drawings in them, and
as you flip through the pages,

492
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,770
you see things moving, but that's
just because your eyes are just

493
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:45,230
seeing little snapshots ever so quickly
of something moving on the paper.

494
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,010
That's all a video file actually is.

495
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,850
So if you have an iPhone and you've
ever played with these animojis,

496
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,180
so to speak, well, all those
are are little video files

497
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,700
composed of lots and
lots and lots of images

498
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,060
that you have saved on your
phone or texted to someone else.

499
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,150
And if we just think, now, we're at
the point of video, but that's OK.

500
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,700
Videos are just bunches of images.

501
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,380
Images are just bunches of colors.

502
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,940
Colors are just patterns of bits.

503
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,650
And bits, at the end
of the day, are just

504
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,800
the result of electricity coming
into my machine or transistors

505
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,570
turning switches on and off.

506
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,170
Like we've all of a sudden to hold
this entire story, but none of us

507
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,710
ever is going to need to really think
about binary in the context of videos

508
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,400
because a video is just an abstraction
on top of bunches of images,

509
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,430
and images are just an abstraction on
top bunches of pixels, and so forth.

510
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,550
So we can keep painting
this hierarchy that

511
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,010
just allows us to talk about
things at a more useful level,

512
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,930
and the reason we had
this conversation is

513
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,480
just because we needed
a way to represent

514
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,440
inputs and outputs to problems.

515
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,400
Let me pause there for just a second
to see if there's any questions.

516
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,830
Anything at all?

517
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,460
No?

518
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,960
All right.

519
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,480
So what's inside this black box?

520
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,080
Well, it turns out this is where
the really interesting work starts

521
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,100
to happen and the thought
starts to come in.

522
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,810
This is the proverbial algorithms,
step by step instructions

523
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,160
for solving some problem.

524
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,410
And some of you might have
solved this problem before,

525
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,480
either digitally or
textually, but of course,

526
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,770
if you have contacts in
your phone these days

527
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,650
and you've got bunches
of friends and family,

528
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,040
odds are they're alphabetized
by first name or last name.

529
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,540
And you have auto complete these
days, but it really is just

530
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,300
a long list of names and numbers.

531
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,890
That's not all that different
from yesteryear's implementation

532
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,640
of the same problem, which was
this device here, a phonebook.

533
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,120
Now, this phonebook might have a
friend of ours in it, say Mike Smith,

534
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,490
whose last name starts with
S. And I could, of course,

535
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,800
if trying to find Mike
Smith, start by looking

536
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,780
at the first page, the second page,
the third page, the fourth page,

537
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,790
and eventually, just
hopefully find Mike Smith.

538
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,640
Indeed, is this algorithm,
this step by step process,

539
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,710
correct for finding
someone like Mike Smith?

540
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,210
Yeah.

541
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:46,940
It's correct.

542
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,970
It's stupid and slow
perhaps because it's

543
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,430
going to take forever in
a phone book of this size,

544
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,390
but it is correct because if Mike's
in here, I will, in fact, find him.

545
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,520
But I could do this better.

546
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,140
I could do it sort of two at a time.

547
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,880
So two, four, six, eight,
10-- or imperfectly--

548
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,560
10, 12, 14.

549
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,450
Is that faster?

550
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,640
Obviously, it's going twice as fast.

551
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,470
Is it correct?

552
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,970
No.

553
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,640
Why is it not correct?

554
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,140
Yeah.

555
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,260
I might miss him, right?

556
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,560
Mike just accidentally might eventually
get sandwiched between two pages

557
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,380
and I have the unlucky
experience of just missing him.

558
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,430
Now, is it fixable?

559
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,030
Yeah.

560
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,440
I can probably, once I hit like SN
or the T section, for instance--

561
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,690
I can just say, obviously,
I've gone too far for Mike.

562
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,830
Let me just double back
one or just a few pages.

563
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,030
So it is fixable.

564
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,380
And so long as I've saved time by
flying through this twice as fast,

565
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,310
can I at least afford to spend a
few more steps at the very end just

566
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,420
to find Mike Smith?

567
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,920
But none of us are going to do that.

568
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,440
And our Apple devices and
Android devices certainly

569
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,330
don't do that for efficiency today.

570
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,210
Odds are most of us are going to do what
to find someone in any book like this?

571
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:48,710
Yeah.

572
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,740
Open to roughly the middle or
maybe bias ourselves toward the end

573
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,090
because S is after the middle.

574
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,340
But you know, I'm in the
middle of the phonebook here.

575
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,730
And now, if I know that Mike is in
the S's and therefore over here,

576
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,260
where do I know he's not?

577
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,200
He's not in the beginning
and I can literally

578
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,670
tear a problem like this in half,
throw figuratively and literally half

579
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,540
of the problem away, and be left
with fundamentally the same problem,

580
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,470
but it's half as big.

581
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,670
I went from like-- whatever--

582
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:17,300
1,000 pages to 500 pages and I
can now repeat this algorithm.

583
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,160
I look down.

584
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,120
I'm a little too far.

585
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,450
I'm in the T section now.

586
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:20,990
OK.

587
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,010
I can again tear the problem
in half, throw that half away,

588
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,180
taking a 500 page byte out, a 250
page byte out, now leaving myself

589
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,040
with just 250 pages more.

590
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,720
And notice just how quickly I got here.

591
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,260
The first two algorithms got me from
1,000 to 999 to 998, or 1,000 to 998

592
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,910
to 996.

593
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,760
But here, I went from
1,000 to 500 to 250.

594
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,660
Feels like we're making up time here.

595
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,540
And indeed, if I keep
repeating this process,

596
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,390
hopefully, I'll be left with
just one page of the book

597
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:55,100
that Mike is either on or not,
at which point, I will call him.

598
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,850
And so that's an algorithm that honestly
leverages probably all the intuition we

599
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,130
have and a lot of what
programming is going to be,

600
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,480
is thinking about a problem like this,
figuring out how to divide and conquer

601
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,500
it, and then expressing
yourself in a way

602
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,030
that the computer can then
solve that problem for you.

603
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,530
And just to paint a picture of how
much better this algorithm is, well,

604
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,890
if this is just a very abstract
chart where we have on the vertical,

605
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,530
or y-axis, how much time it
takes to solve a problem,

606
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,260
and on the horizontal axis
how big the problem is--

607
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,330
so the farther out you go this
way, the more pages in the problem,

608
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,670
the more pages in the phonebook.

609
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,070
And the higher you go up
here, the more seconds or page

610
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,270
turns it's going to take.

611
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,720
That first algorithm is
just like a linear slope,

612
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,660
so to speak, because for every
additional page in the book,

613
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,190
it might take me one more second.

614
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,670
Right, up.

615
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,700
It's just a one for one
relationship with pages.

616
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,820
The second algorithm,
if I plot it, where

617
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,530
I'm flying through
twice as fast, what is

618
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,070
that line going to look like instead?

619
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,930
Yeah.

620
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,550
It's going to look lower than this one.

621
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,550
It's still going to be a straight
line because now, there's a two to one

622
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,580
relationship, but if you've got a
phone book that's got this many pages,

623
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,910
and in the first algorithm,
it took this long, here,

624
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:07,410
well, in the second algorithm, it will
take half as many steps, plus or minus

625
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,840
or two if you need to actually
double back a little bit.

626
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,660
But that third algorithm is
what we'll call logarithmic.

627
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,030
If n is the number of
pages in the phone book,

628
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,890
the first algorithm,
in the very worst case,

629
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,640
might take all n pages
to find Mike Smith.

630
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,470
The second algorithm is going to
take half as many steps because I'm

631
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,920
flying through it two at a time.

632
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,250
But the third algorithm is going
to look and feel like this.

633
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,720
It's going to be curved and ever so
slowly rising and rising and rising,

634
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,950
the implication of which is if
Verizon or the phone company

635
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,790
doubles the number of
pages in the phonebook

636
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,090
next year because Cambridge and
Somerville merged together in the phone

637
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,230
book and we now have 2,000 pages.

638
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,150
Well, how many more steps
does my third algorithm take?

639
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,690
Just one.

640
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,300
Because I can take a 1,000
page bite out of the problem

641
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,140
with that clever algorithm, whereas
my first two algorithms would take it

642
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,150
one or just two pages at a time.

643
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:58,740
So that is to say we have to hugely
increase the size of this problem

644
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,450
just for the number of seconds or page
turns to appreciably actually increase.

645
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,490
And so as we start to
learn about programming,

646
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,670
it's, again, going to be leveraging
of this intuition in order

647
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:13,260
to actually solve problems and
code more effectively than we

648
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,820
might without that intuition alone.

649
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,560
So let's formalize this now.

650
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,920
So that was kind of a very intuitive way
of dividing and conquering a problem.

651
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,750
Just kind of made sense
to go in the middle,

652
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,940
tear it, then go to the
other half or the other half

653
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,010
and tear it again, and so forth.

654
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,990
But a computer, even as cool as Alexa
and Google Home and all of this are,

655
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,120
you can't really just talk
to them as another human

656
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,800
and have them execute things correctly.

657
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,400
I struggle just to get Siri
to set a timer on my phone.

658
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,950
So we're not quite there yet,
so we're still at the age

659
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,830
where we have to be ever
so precise with computers,

660
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,430
voice activated or otherwise, and
so thus enter pseudocode for now.

661
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,560
Pseudocode has no formal definition.

662
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,000
This is just a way of saying use English
like syntax or any spoken language

663
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,210
and just express yourself
succinctly and correctly

664
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,090
so that a computer or a
robot or even another person

665
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,640
can understand what it
is you're trying to say.

666
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,340
So here, I propose, is
an algorithm written

667
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,650
in pseudocode, English like syntax,
that just gets my point across.

668
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,530
And I could write this
in any number of ways.

669
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,680
I've numbered the steps from zero on
up, just for the sake of discussion,

670
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,900
but this would seem to
capture what I did there.

671
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,220
Pick up the phone book.

672
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,840
Open to the middle of the phone.

673
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,710
Look at the names.

674
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,260
If Smith is among the names, call Mike.

675
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,660
Else, if Mike Smith is
earlier in the book,

676
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,050
go to the left, specifically the
middle of the left half of the book,

677
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,910
and then go back to step two.

678
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,650
Because indeed, I was just doing
the same thing again and again,

679
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,350
and the reason I wasn't doing it
forever was because every time I

680
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,060
repeated myself by opening and
tearing, I was shrinking the problem.

681
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,850
And I can only shrink a problem
of some fixed finite size

682
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,220
so many times until I
get just one page, and so

683
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,060
if I continue this logic looking to the
right or to the left or just quitting,

684
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,460
if I don't find Mike at
all on the last page,

685
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,700
this would seem to capture
more precisely that code.

686
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,640
Well, let's actually excerpt
from this now a few concepts

687
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,980
and then start to apply
them to actual code.

688
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,730
Highlighted in yellow here, I dare
say, are all of the verbs or actions.

689
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,550
These are the functions, as we're
going to start calling them,

690
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,330
in this algorithm.

691
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,480
A function is just a specific
step, a specific action

692
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,600
you take in order to do something.

693
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,800
And so in yellow here-- pick up,
open to, look at, call, open, quit

694
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,940
are all actions or verbs.

695
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,400
Are henceforth, we'll
call them functions.

696
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,450
Meanwhile, highlighted in yellow
here-- if, else if, else if, else.

697
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,320
These are kind of
starting to ask questions.

698
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,620
What might these be called
if you have some familiarity?

699
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,120
Yes.

700
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,490
Turns out many programming
languages, if you've seen any before,

701
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,650
would call these conditions.

702
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,060
They're branches, or
proverbial forks in the road.

703
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,840
If this is true, go this way.

704
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,160
Else, maybe go this other way, or
perhaps a third or fourth direction

705
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,030
altogether.

706
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,630
Meanwhile, if we actually look
at these highlighted phrases--

707
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,420
if Smith is among names or
if Smith is earlier in book

708
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,710
or Smith is later in book--

709
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,440
these are the specific questions we're
asking in order to make that decision.

710
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,130
These are known as Boolean
expressions, named after a gentleman

711
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,170
by the last name of
Boole some years ago.

712
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,120
And so a Boolean expression
is just a question

713
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,340
that has a yes or no answer, a
true false answer, a one zero

714
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,710
answer, if you will.

715
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,340
And that's a nice mapping to what
computers are really good at.

716
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,420
So within conditions, you
have Boolean expressions

717
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,680
to decide which fork in the
road you want to go down.

718
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,510
And then lastly,
highlighted in yellow here

719
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:21,210
is go back to step 2
in a couple of places.

720
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,940
This is inducing some
kind of cycle or loop

721
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,750
that's telling the computer to do
something again and again and again.

722
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,620
So in short, we have these building
blocks already conceptually.

723
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,260
And it turns out, we can
now start to translate these

724
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,220
to an actual programming language.

725
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,310
The first of the languages
we'll introduce in CS50

726
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,830
is something called Scratch.

727
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,670
Turns out this is not
a text based language,

728
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,130
like in my English pseudocode
there, but it's graphical

729
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,680
and things look like puzzle
pieces that you can drag and drop

730
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,870
and they interconnect if it
makes logical sense to do so.

731
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,390
And in fact, some of you might have
played this back in the day as kids

732
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,030
or even more recently because
it's actually targeted typically

733
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,910
at students in like
after school programs who

734
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:00,170
just want to learn more methodical, more
algorithmic, or computational thinking.

735
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,930
And we're going to use it to
explore not only these building

736
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,940
blocks, but a few others, as well.

737
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,600
It turns out in the other languages
we'll explore in CS50 and beyond,

738
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,560
are languages like C that we'll actually
transition to as quickly as next week,

739
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,580
to then translate what we do this
week in Scratch to next week in C.

740
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,590
And in languages like
Python and JavaScript

741
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,650
and SQL, which we'll also explore,
do we have other capabilities--

742
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,020
the ability to store data
in variables, so to speak,

743
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,830
to use threads, which means get the
computer to do multiple things at once,

744
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,920
events, to mean listen for
things happening, like a click

745
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,920
on the page or a human typing
or even saying something.

746
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,050
We'll be able to do all of
the things that you take

747
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,180
for granted in your very own phones.

748
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,040
And we'll do this first
by way of this guy.

749
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,060
So this is Scratch, the default cat
that comes with this programming

750
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,890
language from MIT's media lab.

751
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,990
And via Scratch can we start
programming him to move up,

752
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,550
down, left, right, say something,
utter something, and other commands

753
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,580
all together.

754
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,720
In fact, let me go ahead
and switch contexts here

755
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,200
to show you the very first
thing I ever wrote in Scratch.

756
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,370
It was back in the day when
I was in graduate school

757
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,720
and Scratch had just
been invented by MIT.

758
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,540
Let me go ahead and open this.

759
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,710
And I called it Oscar Time.

760
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,630
And if we could perhaps have a
volunteer come on up for just a moment.

761
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,180
You have to be comfortable being
on stage and on the internet.

762
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,590
How about here in the white shirt?

763
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,550
I saw your hand first.

764
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,020
Come on down.

765
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,460
So this is Oscar Time.

766
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,740
It's implemented in a
language called Scratch.

767
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,850
And at the end of the day, all that
is underneath the hood of this program

768
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,190
is functions and loops and conditions
and a few other of these concepts.

769
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,690
Hi.

770
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,080
What's your name?

771
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,870
AVIVA: Aviva.

772
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,280
DAVID MALAN: Aviva.

773
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,710
David.

774
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,410
Nice to meet you.

775
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,980
Come on over here.

776
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,070
And in just a moment, I'm
going to go ahead and click

777
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,230
the green flag at the top
left hand corner, which

778
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,460
is going to play this game.

779
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,330
And we'll see on the
screen the instructions.

780
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,810
[MUSIC PLAYING]

781
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:50,300
OSCAR: (SINGING) Oh, I love trash.

782
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,500
Anything dirty or dingy or dusty.

783
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,670
Anything ragged or rotten or rusty.

784
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,710
Yes, I love trash.

785
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,300
If you really want to see
something trashy, look at this.

786
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,400
I have here a sneaker
that's tattered and worn.

787
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,340
It's all full of holes
and the laces are torn.

788
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,710
A gift from my mother
the day I was born.

789
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:21,270
I love it because it's trash.

790
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:25,650
Oh, I love trash.

791
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:29,880
Anything dirty or dingy or dusty.

792
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,190
Anything ragged or rotten or rusty.

793
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:37,290
Yes, I love trash.

794
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,610
Here's some more rotten stuff.

795
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,370
I have here some
newspaper 13 months old.

796
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,330
DAVID MALAN: All right.

797
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,950
Everybody, give a round of applause
for Aviva for coming on up.

798
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,750
Thank you.

799
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,250
Here.

800
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:48,750
Aviva.

801
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,230
[APPLAUSE]

802
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,180
A little CS50 stress ball.

803
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,150
So suffice it to say, if
you're tired of this song,

804
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,900
consider how tired I was eight hours
later while debugging and building

805
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,590
this program.

806
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,090
But consider what it is we just saw.

807
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:05,610
It's this interactive game and stuff
is animated and music is playing.

808
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:09,560
But if you focus on decomposing,
so to speak, this program into just

809
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,520
basic building blocks, this is just kind
of a big abstraction over some lower

810
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,380
level pieces of functionality.

811
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,580
Like this trash can here.

812
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,830
At the moment, it's just a
picture, and on occasion,

813
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,580
as soon as Aviva dropped something
into the trash, the lid came up

814
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,680
and Oscar came out, he said
something, and then he went back down.

815
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,720
But that animation is super simplistic.

816
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,490
It was just a sequence of 1, 2, 3,
or so images displaying and then

817
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,920
going back down to create
the illusion of animation.

818
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,290
Meanwhile, every time
Oscar said something,

819
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:39,320
that was keeping track of her
score in what's called a variable.

820
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,900
In algebra, you have x and y and z, but
in programming, you have the same idea,

821
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,530
but it's generally more useful
to call them more descriptively,

822
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,370
like your score.

823
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,620
And so there's probably a
variable in this game called

824
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,290
score that was just keeping
track of how many times

825
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,240
Aviva had dropped
something into the trash.

826
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,650
Meanwhile, the trash itself and the
shoe and the newspaper-- and even more

827
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,470
things happen eventually--
were falling from the sky

828
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,680
at sort of random locations, and
that's because I programmed the game

829
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,230
to sort of start the trash
here or over here, just

830
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,950
to make it a little more
challenging as the game picked up.

831
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,540
And in fact, things start falling
faster and faster over time,

832
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,550
like a typical game, getting
more and more difficult.

833
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,830
So how do we get to something like that?

834
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,130
Well, let me go ahead and
open up Scratch itself

835
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,240
and introduce the environment.

836
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,200
So in Scratch, you essentially
have three general areas.

837
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,660
And it's web based, and so you
can do this on any computer.

838
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,510
And in the left hand side here,
you have those puzzle pieces

839
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,920
to which I referred earlier.

840
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,140
These puzzle pieces are all mapping
to functions or loops or conditions

841
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,140
or variables, things that
we saw before, and I'm

842
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,180
going to able to drag and drop
them into the middle in order

843
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,040
to interconnect them
and write my program,

844
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,430
which we'll do in just a moment.

845
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:48,330
Meanwhile, Scratch lives in this stage,
this world, where he can move up,

846
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,250
down, left, right.

847
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,870
You can change what Scratch looks like.

848
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,300
You can add other characters,
otherwise known as sprites,

849
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,140
in order to have multiple
things happening at once.

850
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,680
And of course, you can fullscreen it.

851
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,410
And so the Oscar Time game a moment ago
was actually a whole bunch of sprites.

852
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,250
Oscar's trash can was one.

853
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,640
Each piece of trash was another sprite.

854
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,050
The newspaper was a
sprite, and so forth.

855
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:11,250
So each of them were separate programs
running in parallel at the same time.

856
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,110
So let's actually make him do something.

857
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,770
It turns out that if I
jump down to, say, events,

858
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,770
I'm going to see one of
the most powerful blocks

859
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,000
from the get go, which is
this when green flag clicked.

860
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
That's indeed how I started
the game with Aviva,

861
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,260
by clicking just above
Scratch's world this green flag.

862
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,030
And if I wanted to
stop it, as I did, you

863
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,130
can click the red stop sign to say stop.

864
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,730
Meanwhile, the green
flag, I can constantly

865
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,220
listen for by dragging and
dropping this puzzle piece.

866
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,710
When the green flag is
clicked, what do I want to do?

867
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,470
Well, let me go up to looks.

868
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,140
And these are just different categories.

869
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,180
And we can scroll through all
the different colorful blocks,

870
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,240
but they pretty much
just do what they say.

871
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,370
I'm going to go under looks, where I
know there to be a block that's called

872
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,990
say, and I'm going to go ahead and type
the most canonical computer science

873
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,500
thing-- hello world--

874
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,160
in this box.

875
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,550
So notice that functions
themselves can actually

876
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,610
take inputs and the input
to this function, say,

877
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,080
is going to be hello world.

878
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,530
If I now go over to the
green flag and click it--

879
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,530
hello world.

880
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,030
All right.

881
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,000
So not all that difficult.
Not all that interesting.

882
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,810
But it actually got the job done, and
so my program is indeed just this.

883
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,060
Well, how might I make this
a little more interesting?

884
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,730
Just saying, hello world all the
time isn't all that compelling.

885
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,620
Well, you know what?

886
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,170
Let me think.

887
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,550
Let me undo this.

888
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,380
Let me scroll down to sensing.

889
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,880
And notice this.

890
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,490
Functions can also
take input from a human

891
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:32,270
and functions can hand you back a
value, a so-called return value.

892
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,090
So this block here, ask
something-- by default, it says,

893
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,500
what's your name and weight--

894
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,350
is another function built into
Scratch that allows me to do this.

895
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,420
So I'm going to go
ahead and drag this here

896
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,950
and I'm going to let it
say, what's your name?

897
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,990
Notice now that below this
block is a special block,

898
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,650
whatever it is the block returns.

899
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,560
So answer is whatever the
human is going to type in.

900
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,060
And if I want to now say what the human
typed in, let me go again to looks.

901
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,060
Go to say.

902
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,150
And notice that these
blocks are kind of magnetic.

903
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,340
They want to snap together.

904
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,130
So I'm going to go
ahead and let go there.

905
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,160
And if I go back to
sensing and grab answer,

906
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,730
notice that even though it's
not quite the same size,

907
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,740
it's going to grow to
fill, and now, I can

908
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,890
have my program ask the user
what his or her name is and then

909
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,930
say whatever that answer is.

910
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:18,020
So let me go ahead and
stop and click play again.

911
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,020
Notice it's asking me for my name,
so let me go ahead and type in David.

912
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,020
Enter.

913
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,520
OK.

914
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,770
It's a little weird
way to greet someone.

915
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,790
David.

916
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,490
So it'd be nice to clean that up a bit.

917
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,330
So you know what?

918
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,380
I know this only from
having poked around before.

919
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,230
Not all of this is
obvious at first glance.

920
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,320
But it turns out that under
operators, the category,

921
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,070
there's this thing here--
join apple and banana.

922
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,320
Which are just default values.

923
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,460
You can change them.

924
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,710
Because what do I want to do?

925
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:47,720
I want to say hello, David, or whoever,
so I kind of want to say hello, comma,

926
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,710
and then, David-- whatever
the human typed in.

927
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,090
And that's what join lets you do.

928
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:54,880
It lets you join or concatenate
two phrases that are somehow

929
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,140
provided by you or the user.

930
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,690
So let me pull this out, the answer.

931
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,750
Let me go ahead and grab the join block.

932
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,650
Notice it, too, is
going to grow to fill.

933
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:09,010
Let me go ahead and say, hello, comma,
space, and now, drag answer into there.

934
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,770
And notice this nesting.

935
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,520
Just like in math.

936
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,360
This nesting of functions.

937
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,700
I can first join hello and answer
by taking those two things as input

938
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,710
and then pass them to
say as another input

939
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,480
because these things are layered on top.

940
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,420
And so now, if I stop this and
play it again and say, David--

941
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,250
hello, David.

942
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,700
Now, we have the makings of a more
interesting interactive program

943
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,290
that isn't just hardcoded.

944
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:38,080
Of course, it's not nearly as audible as
something like Oscar Time a moment ago.

945
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,380
So let me go ahead and do this.

946
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,660
Let me start over altogether and
treat Scratch like the cat he is

947
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,570
and just start the sound called meow.

948
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,130
So it turns out there's a
category of blocks called sound,

949
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,740
and within sound, there is
play some default sounds.

950
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,400
So start sound meow.

951
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,070
And now, things will get a little cuter.

952
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,480
[MEOW]

953
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,940
Aw.

954
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,010
And now, again.

955
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,010
[MEOW]

956
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:03,200
And I can kind of simulate a cat
by [MEOW] standing here for a while

957
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,610
and keeping to click this button.

958
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,360
But you know what?

959
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,890
Let me make him meow few times
because that's more realistic.

960
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,580
So let me grab a second
one and a third one.

961
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,570
And you can get this
infinite supply of blocks.

962
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,230
Let me hit play.

963
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,620
[MEOW]

964
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,320
Seems like a bug.

965
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,990
Let's try again.

966
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,780
Play.

967
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,140
[MEOW]

968
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,570
This is my first bug, or mistake.

969
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,710
This looks correct.

970
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,700
It says when green flag clicked,
start sound meow, start sound meow,

971
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,020
start sound meow.

972
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,490
Why am I only hearing one meow?

973
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,980
Yeah.

974
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,960
They're kind of at the same time
or so close to the same time

975
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,050
that the sounds are kind of tripping
over each other and just overlapping,

976
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,550
right?

977
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,720
The block literally
says, start sound meow.

978
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,120
But computers are really fast.

979
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,030
If you've heard of the expression
gigahertz, that's a unit of measure.

980
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:52,300
And if your computer has a one gigahertz
CPU, central processing unit, or brain,

981
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,660
that means it can literally do
like a billion things per second.

982
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,200
It can certainly start
three sounds super fast.

983
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,200
And if they're effectively all
happening one after the other

984
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,290
before the sound even finishes,
you're just hearing one net effect.

985
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,680
So how can we fix this?

986
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,880
Well, I can actually go and
fix this with this block here--

987
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,190
play sound meow until done.

988
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,550
Play sound meow until done.

989
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,240
And now.

990
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,510
[MEOWING]

991
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,010
OK.

992
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,890
It's a little unhappy,
this particular cat,

993
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,730
but at least it's now more correct.

994
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,420
And, as it turns out,
if I go to control--

995
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,100
you know what?

996
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,770
There's this block here--
wait some number of seconds.

997
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,940
I can go ahead and insert this here.

998
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,560
Let me do another one here.

999
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,510
And now, hit play.

1000
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,910
[MEOWING]

1001
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,170
You know, it's not bad.

1002
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,230
It now sounds a little more realistic.

1003
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,510
But honestly, if I keep doing
this-- or you know what?

1004
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,840
You can actually right click
or control click on blocks,

1005
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,020
duplicate them, and just copy and
paste even more if you want them.

1006
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,440
So if I were to do this, now,
it's just going to go six times.

1007
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,390
And then I could copy it
again and go 12 times.

1008
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,140
But there's got to be
a better way, right?

1009
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,480
This is now bad programming.

1010
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,770
This is bad design.

1011
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:04,620
Because I'm literally copying
and pasting, albeit, graphically.

1012
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,170
But we've already seen a
building block with which

1013
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,390
we can design this program better.

1014
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,190
It's correct, but it's
not well designed.

1015
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:15,820
What would the building block be that
I need to make this a little cleaner?

1016
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,320
OK.

1017
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:16,860
A four loop.

1018
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,150
Doesn't quite exist in Scratch.

1019
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,300
But a loop fundamentally
does something cyclically.

1020
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,980
And indeed, if I go under
control and start poking around,

1021
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,910
you'll notice that there's a few
blocks that might apply here.

1022
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,010
There's the repeat block
some number of times

1023
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,400
or the forever block, both of
which sound like loops, or cycles.

1024
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,460
So sure enough, let me go ahead
here and I can throw away blocks

1025
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,110
by just dragging them to the left.

1026
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,080
Let me pull this out for a second.

1027
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,460
And then just say forever play this
sound, and then wait one second.

1028
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,070
So now, my program looks like this.

1029
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:50,360
[MEOWING]

1030
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:56,770
You know, we'll never know if it's
technically correct because it's just

1031
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:00,130
going to go, we think, forever,
but it looks like this is correct.

1032
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,320
And it was a lot less
code and it's a lot easier

1033
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,260
to maintain because if I want
him to kind of get sleepy,

1034
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,150
I can then maybe say
two seconds instead.

1035
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,560
[MEOW]

1036
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,730
You know, and we can adjust
this on the fly as we go.

1037
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,710
But let's start to combine
some of these ideas

1038
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,460
now and change what it is
the ultimate effect is.

1039
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,310
Let me go ahead and open an
example I made in advance.

1040
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:24,260
This one's called Count Zero.

1041
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,510
And we'll put this on the website later
so that you can play with if you like.

1042
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,630
And this is kind of the
opposite of counting sheep.

1043
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,180
Rather than me or the person
sleeping counting sheep,

1044
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,440
this sheep will count itself.

1045
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,130
So let me go ahead and just play.

1046
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:41,720
And adorably, he seems to
just be counting 1, 2, 3.

1047
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,800
But why is that?

1048
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,420
He's just going to count forever.

1049
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,330
But let's look at the blocks with
which he is counting forever.

1050
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,420
When green flag clicked, set counter.

1051
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,720
Turns out this orange box is
what we called a variable.

1052
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,570
So in algebra, it would
be like x or y or z.

1053
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,780
Those are not descriptive.

1054
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,490
I called this one counter instead, but
I could have called it x or y or z.

1055
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:03,080
And then I forever say the counter
for one second, then wait one second,

1056
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,910
and then change the
counter by one, which

1057
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,410
technically means just increment it.

1058
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:07,430
Add 1 to it.

1059
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:10,190
And the sheep is just going to
therefore count up and up and up.

1060
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,900
Now, this is a little
tedious, but that's

1061
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,120
kind of the point of counting
sheep, of course, to fall asleep.

1062
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,960
But what if the sheep actually kind
of liked counting a little faster?

1063
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,500
Well, let me go under operators here.

1064
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,860
Multiplication sounds like it
could get us places quicker.

1065
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,260
And let me go ahead and go to variables.

1066
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,830
And instead of changing
the counter by one,

1067
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:32,290
let me go ahead and just keep
setting it to something else.

1068
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,530
So let me drag and drop this.

1069
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:38,360
Set the counter equal to something
times something, specifically

1070
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:44,810
the counter times two, thereby
doubling, doubling, doubling, doubling.

1071
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:47,250
That would seem to grow,
so to speak, a lot faster.

1072
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,400
Let's see.

1073
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,210
1, 2, 4.

1074
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,780
So he's counting faster, but
it's still kind of tedious.

1075
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,640
What if we instead do this?

1076
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,660
Let's stop waiting and let's
go ahead and, with the looks,

1077
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,960
not say counter for one second,
but let's just quickly say counter.

1078
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,300
So I'm going to say the counter.

1079
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,290
Whoops.

1080
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:13,460
I'm going to say the counter and then
I'm going to set it to itself times 2.

1081
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,560
So here's where we're at.

1082
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,950
Initialize, or set the counter to 1
initially, say it, then double it,

1083
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:21,930
then double it, then double
it, saying it along the way.

1084
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,690
So here we go.

1085
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:26,720
That's impressive.

1086
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,320
So now the sheep has counted
up to 10 to the 60th so far.

1087
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,160
10 to the 100th.

1088
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,660
OK.

1089
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:39,370
Now, it doesn't even fit in the
speech bubble, but he's still going.

1090
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,380
How high can he go?

1091
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:45,970
What's the biggest number you
can count to in a computer?

1092
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:49,410
Anyone want to guess?

1093
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,400
Could be here a while.

1094
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,130
10 to the 270th now.

1095
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:57,530
How high can you count, or rather--

1096
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:58,030
OK.

1097
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,010
So we gave up and just
called it infinity.

1098
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,340
So it turns out infinity
does have a precise value--

1099
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,680
10 to the 250th or so.

1100
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,150
But what happens here?

1101
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,490
Well, because computers,
at the end of the day,

1102
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,700
are just storing information digitally--
but that information digitally has

1103
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,640
to be physically stored using
electricity, using these lower level

1104
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,990
switches called transistors.

1105
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:20,200
At the end of the day, my phone, my
laptop, whatever device in question

1106
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,510
only has a finite
amount of those things.

1107
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:24,380
I only have a finite number of fingers.

1108
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,800
Using unary, my old
school hashmark approach,

1109
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,360
I can count to five on this hand.

1110
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,380
Using binary, I claimed I
could count to 31 on this hand.

1111
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,610
But it's still finite.

1112
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:37,270
I cannot count to infinity on this
hand because I only have five fingers.

1113
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:40,570
Similarly does a computer only
have so many transistors or so

1114
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:43,240
many bytes or bits of
memory, and at some point,

1115
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,790
the programmer has to
think about what is he

1116
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:48,580
or she going to do when the user
wants to count so high that you

1117
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,080
can't physically fit it anymore.

1118
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,310
You have to give up like this
and say something semi accurately

1119
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:57,980
or you have to handle that
issue in some other way.

1120
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,180
And we'll see when we get to C that
how you handle this problem is not

1121
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,730
necessarily straightforward,
and indeed a lot of software

1122
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,610
out there does not handle this problem.

1123
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,660
And odds are, all of us
have programs that if you

1124
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,180
type big enough words or big
enough numbers into them,

1125
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,970
they might very well
break or crash or freeze

1126
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:16,600
because the humans, unlike MIT, did
not anticipate that that might actually

1127
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,890
happen and handle it.

1128
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,310
Well, let me go ahead and do this.

1129
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:22,780
Let me open up this program and
see if we can't read the code now.

1130
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:28,330
This is called Pet Zero and this is
a program that simulates petting.

1131
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:31,630
So if I click play and
don't touch the keyboard,

1132
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:35,350
nothing seems to be happening, but if
I now move my cursor over to the cat--

1133
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,800
[MEOW]

1134
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,770
Aw.

1135
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:38,590
It's kind of cute.

1136
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:39,280
[MEOW]

1137
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,790
Right now, it's more only meowing
on demand when you pet the cat.

1138
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:43,480
Why?

1139
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,640
Well, notice I've added
some other building blocks.

1140
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,130
We haven't used this one
before, but it intuitively

1141
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:49,630
probably makes pretty clear sense.

1142
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:52,660
When the green flag is clicked,
forever do the following.

1143
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,070
If the cat is touching the mouse
pointer-- this thing in blue

1144
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:58,030
is what we called earlier
a Boolean expression.

1145
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,760
It has a yes/no, a
true/false, a one/zero answer.

1146
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,560
And touching mouse pointer is one
of the options in the little drop

1147
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,150
down here if you tinker with it.

1148
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:08,290
So if the cat is touching the
mouse pointer, then and only then,

1149
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,450
play sound meow until done.

1150
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:14,200
So we've combined now functions
with loops with a condition.

1151
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,330
But why the loop?

1152
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,390
The cat's only meowing
once when I pet him.

1153
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,580
Why am I doing anything forever here?

1154
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:25,530
Someone-- yeah.

1155
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,100
Yeah.

1156
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,910
I might want to pet it again, so I
want the program to anticipate that.

1157
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:36,480
And honestly, if I omitted this
forever block and my program

1158
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,130
instead looked just like this--

1159
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,890
so let me get rid of that and this--

1160
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:45,780
and then I clicked play,
and now, I hover over him,

1161
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,550
why is it not working even once?

1162
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,090
Say it again.

1163
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,200
Yeah.

1164
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,740
So I mean, at this point,
if I can summarize,

1165
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,080
the computer is so damn
fast that this already

1166
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,190
happened by the time I moved my cursor
over to the cat, and at the moment

1167
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:10,220
I clicked play, I was
not touching the cat.

1168
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,780
Those blocks executed, so
to speak, top to bottom.

1169
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,970
That's it for the program.

1170
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,970
So by the time I move the cursor
over to the cat, the program is over.

1171
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:17,760
It's not listening.

1172
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,960
And so forever, this way I can actually
listen in perpetuity for something

1173
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,430
to actually happen.

1174
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,000
What if I want to do something
not just if something is true,

1175
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,300
but handle two cases?

1176
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,340
If or else.

1177
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,130
Well, let me go ahead
and open up Pet One.

1178
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,870
And this is another example.

1179
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:37,310
And could someone perhaps describe,
after reading this code, what

1180
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,810
this program is going to do instead?

1181
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:42,790
Yeah.

1182
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:54,300
Exactly.

1183
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,750
And let me summarize more verbally.

1184
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:59,590
So if this time, you're touching
the cat, it's going to roar instead.

1185
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,950
Else, it's just going to meow sweetly.

1186
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:05,830
So this time, it is meowing
perpetually once every second,

1187
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,850
but if you touch this particular
cat, it doesn't like it.

1188
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:09,660
So play.

1189
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,570
[MEOW]

1190
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,070
Meow.

1191
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,310
[MEOW]

1192
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:13,130
Meow.

1193
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,350
[MEOW]

1194
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,360
And now.

1195
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,320
[ROAR]

1196
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,640
Don't touch the cat.

1197
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,160
So now, we might interact
in two different ways

1198
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,970
by having two different
roads that you can go down.

1199
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,560
Well, let's actually make something
a little more interactive.

1200
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,730
Let me go ahead and
open another example.

1201
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,850
This one's called Bounce
Zero because now, we

1202
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:33,690
can start to see some design
elements from what Oscar Time was.

1203
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:36,360
Like this now it's getting
a little interesting.

1204
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,350
What is actually going on here?

1205
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,470
So let me zoom in on the blocks here.

1206
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,980
This block is just saying
forever move 10 steps, which

1207
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,360
is another block we haven't seen.

1208
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,920
But 10 steps is like 10 pixels.

1209
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,930
So move 10 pixels on the screen.

1210
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:52,330
But if you're touching the edge,
then turn around 180 degrees.

1211
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,200
And you can see exactly that happening.

1212
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,540
Scratch is turning around 180
degrees and this rotation style just

1213
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,320
means double back.

1214
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,810
Don't like loop around 180 degrees.

1215
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,020
So that's kind of cool.

1216
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:05,100
But this is not how humans or cats walk.

1217
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:10,340
Like what is obviously
unnatural about this?

1218
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:10,840
Yeah.

1219
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,840
I mean, I mean, I can't
even simulate it, right?

1220
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,580
Like his feet are in static
position, yet sliding back and forth

1221
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,540
on the screen.

1222
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,160
And yet, that is not what walking is.

1223
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,950
Like walking presumably has
some kind of movement and what?

1224
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,870
Well, we could just kind
of simulate it like--

1225
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,190
OK, I could just walk--

1226
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:28,420
walking and you can imagine taking like
really quick photographs of my legs

1227
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:31,450
or the cat's leg moving and
then just deciding this photo

1228
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:33,400
will be representative of one step.

1229
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,530
This photo will be
representative another.

1230
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:37,810
And you know, with just
two of those steps,

1231
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:41,320
I'd wager we could actually do
a pretty good job of simulating

1232
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,620
what walking looks like.

1233
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,210
In fact, if I go back to where we
began, this picture of Scratch,

1234
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:51,040
what if I just move his legs
ever so slightly, then go back,

1235
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,280
then go forward?

1236
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,050
And even just in my PDF, I can
simulate animation by hitting up arrow,

1237
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:58,670
down arrow, up arrow, down
arrow because it kind of

1238
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:01,720
looks like he's walking now, when
really, your human eyes are just seeing

1239
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,250
two different pictures again and again.

1240
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,340
So how can I do this?

1241
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,350
Well, if I go back to
Scratch, he's still walking.

1242
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:15,500
Let me go ahead and open up Bounce One,
the second version of this, and now,

1243
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,300
do this.

1244
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,630
OK.

1245
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,570
So how did I add this?

1246
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,870
There's a little purple block
that we haven't seen yet,

1247
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,740
but if you poke around
the categories, you'll

1248
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,070
see other blocks like this
next costume that just keeps

1249
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,230
changing the costume that he's wearing.

1250
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,860
It turns out Scratch exists as a
picture and his default picture

1251
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,760
is him not moving, but if I go up
here to top left and click costumes,

1252
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,220
you can actually see that
here's his one costume.

1253
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,960
Here's his second costume.

1254
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,140
And so that purple block that
says next costume, because it's

1255
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:47,460
in the forever loop, it just keeps
doing next, next, next, next, next, just

1256
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,240
showing one costume or the other.

1257
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,210
They're clearly mimicking walking.

1258
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:53,640
Now, this is not very unnatural.

1259
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:59,040
Why don't we slow him down to, say, five
steps at a time and have him go again?

1260
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,660
Now, this is still going pretty fast.

1261
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,240
Let me go ahead and say--

1262
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,010
we could have control.

1263
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:11,100
We could have him wait a second
after moving very dramatically.

1264
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,550
We could probably speed this up.

1265
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,540
So let's wait 1/10 of a second, 0.1.

1266
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,650
Or maybe let's do 0.01,
1/100 of a second.

1267
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,400
Now, it's getting a
little more realistic.

1268
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,810
But this is what animation is.

1269
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:25,510
If you've ever watched a cartoon or
a movie based on pictures like this,

1270
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:28,530
you're just tinkering with some
of these parameters, these inputs,

1271
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,780
in order to produce this
output by understanding

1272
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,260
what the fundamental representation
of these things is, which in this case

1273
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,200
are just pictures, again
and again and again in order

1274
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,700
to create that animation.

1275
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,400
But what about interactivity?

1276
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,490
Let me do this one myself.

1277
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:45,960
Let me go ahead and get rid of
this, go back to events, and say,

1278
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,670
when green flag clicked.

1279
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:50,250
Then, let me go ahead
and grab a forever block

1280
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,230
so that this keeps
going again and again.

1281
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:54,150
And then, let me go
ahead to go to motion.

1282
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,270
It turns out that under motion,
there's this block we haven't seen--

1283
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,340
point towards the mouse pointer.

1284
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,650
And let me go ahead
and pull this in here.

1285
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:06,480
And then, let me have it move just
like one step at a time, instead of 10.

1286
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,560
What is this going to do?

1287
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,490
What's this program do?

1288
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:12,990
Yeah.

1289
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,370
Say it again.

1290
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,280
Follow the mouse.

1291
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:15,780
Yeah.

1292
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:20,580
This is kind of like a way of
taking your cat for a walk.

1293
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,930
Perhaps not quite the animal we
intended, but he'll follow the cursor.

1294
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:27,170
And I can actually speed
this up a little bit.

1295
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,780
So let's have him move 10 steps.

1296
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,280
OK.

1297
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,020
Now, there we go.

1298
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,960
So now, he's moving up and down,
and so now, it's interactive.

1299
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,650
So you might recall that when we were
playing Oscar Time earlier and picking

1300
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,150
up--

1301
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,530
OK.

1302
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,110
Don't do that.

1303
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:42,870
See, that's a bug.

1304
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:43,710
He's just confused.

1305
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,660
He's constantly moving toward
it, but you're already--

1306
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:45,940
OK.

1307
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,930
So we're going to stop.

1308
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:47,430
OK.

1309
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:50,610
So now, he's following, but
that's how we might now create,

1310
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,980
for instance, the ability to
move those pieces of trash

1311
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,950
around and have them
follow the mouse cursor.

1312
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,070
If you think back to Oscar Time, every
time you picked up a piece of trash,

1313
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:01,320
he'd follow the cursor because there
was a forever loop and a block like this

1314
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,180
pointing toward the mouse pointer.

1315
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,760
Well, now, let's
integrate multiple ideas

1316
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,590
and actually have multiple scripts.

1317
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:12,240
I proposed earlier that programs
can actually have multiple threads.

1318
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,780
A thread is just a fancy way of saying,
in our context, multiple scripts.

1319
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:21,120
Multiple scripts in one program that
are happening essentially in parallel.

1320
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,570
A computer can effectively do multiple
things at a time thanks to threading,

1321
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,010
and more on that down the road.

1322
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,720
So these are more
involved, but let's see

1323
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,120
if we can-- let's understand
first what this program does.

1324
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,320
Let me go ahead and hit play.

1325
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,950
And this one tends to be a little loud.

1326
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,180
[SEA LION BARKING]

1327
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:42,800
So the sea lion is just
barking endlessly, annoyingly.

1328
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:48,650
So by reading the code, how
can I stop him from barking?

1329
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:49,890
Hit the spacebar.

1330
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:50,390
All right.

1331
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:52,770
So hit the spacebar.

1332
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:53,750
OK.

1333
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,700
I could just stop the
program, obviously,

1334
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,800
but this program is still
running, technically.

1335
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,270
But why did that work?

1336
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:02,300
Well, notice this on the left
hand side is the first script.

1337
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:06,370
When the green flag is clicked, set this
variable that I called muted to false.

1338
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:08,960
Could have called it x or y or
z or counter, but none of those

1339
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,620
really make sense, so I called it muted.

1340
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,400
And I set it equal to false,
which is, again, a Boolean value.

1341
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,170
True or false just mean yes or no.

1342
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:19,920
Forever, if the keyspace
is pressed, then do this.

1343
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,200
If muted is currently false,
then change muted to true.

1344
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,670
Else, change muted to false.

1345
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,510
So if muted is false, change it to true.

1346
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,840
If muted is true, change it to false.

1347
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,910
Any time the human hits the
spacebar, update that variable.

1348
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:39,500
Now, if we look at the other script,
which is also driving the sea lion,

1349
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,530
what is he doing?

1350
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,580
Forever, if muted is false.

1351
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,750
So if he's not muted.

1352
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,820
If muted is false means not muted.

1353
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:50,360
Start the sound sea lion and then
think hi, hi, hi for two seconds,

1354
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,160
and then wait for one more second.

1355
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,900
And then just repeat, repeat, repeat.

1356
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,750
But if I change with the
spacebar muted to true,

1357
00:58:56,750 --> 00:59:00,230
he's going to say if muted
equals false, that's not so.

1358
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,950
I'm not going to play a sound this time.

1359
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:05,360
And so now, we have the ability to
integrate multiple scripts together

1360
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,390
in order to achieve a
more interactive result.

1361
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:09,670
And what about this?

1362
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:15,560
Back when I was a kid, might have
played in the summers Marco Polo.

1363
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,650
Super simple game.

1364
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,650
We played it in the pool,
for some reason, where

1365
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,840
one person in the pool
very safely is blindfolded,

1366
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,550
and then he or she yells Marco.

1367
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,550
And then, everyone around him
or her is supposed to yell polo.

1368
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,260
And then, the person
who's blindfolded is

1369
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,540
supposed to go chase the other
kids in the pool and tag them,

1370
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,650
and then they become it.

1371
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,020
But in other words, it's this
like signaling mechanism.

1372
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,750
Someone yells, Marco and
everyone else responds

1373
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:38,180
to that broadcast of the word Marco.

1374
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,910
Well, it turns out we can simulate
this with these two puppets.

1375
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,550
This guy here-- notice that I've
highlighted the orange puppet

1376
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:45,350
because there's a second
blue puppet there.

1377
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,220
Separate sprites.

1378
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,490
And these are just photographs
we uploaded to the game.

1379
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:53,780
Forever, if the key space is pressed,
so if the spacebar is pressed,

1380
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:57,290
say Marco for two seconds
and then broadcast an event.

1381
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:02,350
Meanwhile, the blue puppet
here has a super simple block,

1382
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:04,770
but it's fundamentally different
from the ones we've seen.

1383
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:07,580
He's not starting when
the green flag is clicked.

1384
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,730
He is starting only when
he receives an event.

1385
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:13,470
So it turns out that sprites
and Scratch can't hear or see

1386
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,680
what the other one is saying
in those speech bubbles.

1387
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,420
You have to use a
fancier technique, which

1388
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,430
is the special block
called broadcast, which

1389
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:23,390
is like passing a note digitally
from one sprite to another

1390
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:26,210
that the other one can read
or receive, so to speak.

1391
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:28,430
So only when he receives
this event, so to speak,

1392
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:30,800
does he say polo for two seconds.

1393
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,350
And again, the orange puppet
sends that secret message

1394
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:35,810
just using this other puzzle piece.

1395
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:40,530
Broadcast an event, like passing a note
that the human doesn't actually see.

1396
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:45,410
So if I now hit the green flag and
hit the spacebar, orange yells Marco.

1397
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:48,380
Blue guy yells polo in response.

1398
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,270
But those aren't timed together.

1399
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:53,690
Rather, the blue guy is hearing
with the orange one has said,

1400
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:58,740
thereby allowing multiple sprites
to actually intercommunicate.

1401
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,780
So how did we get here?

1402
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,930
Well, recall that we had all of
these building blocks a moment ago.

1403
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,270
First, we started out with
just functions and conditions

1404
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,710
and Boolean expressions and loops.

1405
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:09,040
We've now added to that the
ability to store information

1406
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,530
in variables and threads to do multiple
things at once, and then, if you do

1407
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:14,840
have multiple things
happening, events, where

1408
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,180
they can enter communicate somehow.

1409
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,530
Yet another building block.

1410
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:21,620
So if we now take a
step back and consider

1411
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:26,360
how we can make functions of
our own, we have the final piece

1412
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,890
of the puzzle, so to speak.

1413
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:29,090
Let me go ahead and do this.

1414
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:33,500
Let me go ahead and create a simple
program with, when green flag clipped,

1415
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,570
that simply simulates
coughing for a cat.

1416
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:40,760
So this cat is going to say not
hello, but cough for one second.

1417
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:44,540
And then he's going to go
ahead and wait for one second.

1418
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:48,200
And then I'm going to go ahead
and copy paste, as I did before--

1419
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,040
this is one of those do as I say, not as
I do-- to implement this program here,

1420
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,170
where he coughs three times.

1421
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:57,020
We already know, though, from
earlier that this is not good design.

1422
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:59,430
Why?

1423
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:00,520
You're repeating yourself.

1424
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,080
Don't repeat yourself.

1425
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,570
DRY is an acronym, actually.

1426
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:05,320
Don't repeat yourself
because you're doing

1427
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:09,340
three times as many times something
that you only really need to do once.

1428
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:12,680
The solution before, of course,
was just use a loop of some sort.

1429
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,230
So let me actually take that out.

1430
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:18,130
Let me use a repeat
block, change 10 to three,

1431
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,810
and then just use two of these blocks.

1432
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:22,150
And notice already, the program
is so much more compact.

1433
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:27,040
And now, if I want to change the three
to a 30 or to a 10 or any number,

1434
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,550
I just change one simple value.

1435
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:31,840
I don't have to rewrite or
copy paste or delete things.

1436
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,820
I can update the program
much more readily,

1437
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:39,370
and now, the same thing is going to
happen with just cough, cough, cough.

1438
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:43,010
But it turns out that it would be nice
to henceforth abstract away from this,

1439
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:43,510
right?

1440
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:46,960
I just want any program I
write to know how to cough.

1441
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,210
And coughing is really just
saying something, perhaps

1442
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:50,540
some number of times.

1443
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:53,110
But it turns out we can
abstract this away in code.

1444
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:55,930
Let me go down to my
blocks here and this allows

1445
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:57,710
me to click this button-- make a block.

1446
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,440
It allows me to make my own function.

1447
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,120
I get this dialog window here.

1448
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,850
And I'm just going to
call this block cough.

1449
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:05,870
I'm going to go ahead and click OK.

1450
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:09,420
And now, I have this new pink block that
itself can have blocks underneath it.

1451
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,840
And you know what I'm going to do?

1452
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,410
I'm going to go ahead and do this.

1453
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:16,570
I'm going to go ahead and
say cough under there.

1454
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:20,260
And now, notice on the left, I now
have access to this new pink piece.

1455
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,220
I can now put this in here.

1456
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:26,470
So now, notice even though, yes,
this is how coughing is implemented

1457
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:30,320
on the left hand side here, next
time, when I write a program,

1458
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,960
I just want to call cough.

1459
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,630
And I don't care about those lower
level implementation details.

1460
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:36,460
I don't care about the
party or any of that.

1461
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,230
I just want this to be an abstraction.

1462
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:40,510
But I could do better
than this wouldn't it

1463
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:43,730
be nice if instead of just
repeating cough three times,

1464
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:45,670
what if I made that a feature of cough?

1465
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:46,760
So let me do this.

1466
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:51,010
I can go ahead and right click on
this pink piece and I can edit it.

1467
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,990
That brings up that
same window from before.

1468
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:53,710
And notice this.

1469
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:55,070
Add an input.

1470
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:58,210
So when I make a custom block, I can
actually make pretty fancy blocks

1471
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:01,570
just like the ones MIT
gives us with the software,

1472
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,700
and now, I can type in something like n.

1473
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:07,060
And if I add a label just to make it
more descriptive, I can just say times.

1474
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,040
So now, I've made a
special custom puzzle

1475
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,880
piece that says cough some number
of times, where n for number

1476
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,340
is just the go to variable
that programmers tend to use.

1477
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:24,260
So now, I can actually move this
repeat block into cough itself,

1478
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,290
but rather than hard
code 3, notice this.

1479
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:31,360
I can steal that variable and now say
cough this many times by repeating

1480
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,630
saying this again and again and again.

1481
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:39,880
And now, when I cough in my actual
program, I just type in three here.

1482
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,350
So I have this beautiful
abstraction now, so to speak.

1483
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:45,490
Cough this many times and I
and no one else in the world

1484
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:48,730
never again needs to care about what
it means to cough because we've already

1485
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:50,330
implemented that before.

1486
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:52,810
And so just as MIT has given
us so much functionality

1487
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:54,940
that we ourselves don't
have to think about, so can

1488
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:57,560
I now make functionality that
I don't have to think about.

1489
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,340
And as we progress to higher level
languages like C and JavaScript

1490
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,800
and Python, we're going to
continue this process, sometimes

making our own custom puzzle pieces,

1492

things called libraries,

1493
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:13,060

that's just useful to get the job done,

here in part for us.

There's some kind of ask block.

As you know, CS50 is offered not only
at Harvard, but at Yale, as well,

1532
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,810

perhaps end on a note that

the other by way of another game
